If you currently have the Managed Infrastructure support service level for
Rackspace Public Cloud, you can upgrade to the Managed Operations service level.

**Note:** To identify your current support service level, log in to the Cloud
Control Panel and check beneath your account name in the top-right corner of the
panel for a label that names your support service level. For current service
support levels, see the [Support Levels](https://www.rackspace.com/openstack/public/service-levels)
comparison tool.

### Upgrade to the Managed Operations service level

1.  In the Cloud Control Panel, beneath your account name, click **Managed
    Infrastructure**.

2.  Click **View our service level details** in the pop-up box.

3.  *(Optional)* Compare your current service level with the other available
    service levels.

4.  *(Optional)* Click **View Server Pricing** for any of the options to
    calculate an estimate of your services with the selected service level.

5.  To upgrade your service level to Managed Operations, click **Learn More**
    under Managed Operations.

    **Important:** If you upgrade your service level, you cannot revert back to
    the previous level.

6.  In the pop-up window, click **Request Upgrade**.

7.  On the Confirm Managed Operations Upgrade page, read the information
    provided. Open the **Terms of Service** link and read the terms of service.

8.  If you agree to the terms, select both check boxes, and then click **Request Upgrade**.

    A confirmation of your upgrade is displayed on the screen.

**Note:** You will see the changes in effect the next time you log in.

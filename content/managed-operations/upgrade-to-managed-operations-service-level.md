Depending on your Support Service Level for Rackspace Public Cloud, you have the option to upgrade from the Managed Infrastructure service level to the Managed Ops: SysOps service level.

**Note:** To identify your current Support Service Level, log in to your
account and check in the top-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel for
one of the following labels: **Managed Infrastructure** or **Managed Ops:
SysOps**.

### Upgrade from the Managed Infrastructure service level

1.  In the Cloud Control Panel, under your account name, click **Managed
    Infrastructure**.

2.  To view your current service level and upgrade options, click **View
    our service level details** in the popup box.

3.  *(Optional)* Compare your current service level with the other
    available service levels.

4.  *(Optional)* Click **View Server Pricing** for any of the options to
    calculate an estimate of your services with the selected
    service level.

5.  To upgrade your service level to Managed Ops: SysOps or Managed Ops:
    DevOps, click **Select** at the bottom of the appropriate column.

    **Note:** If you upgrade your service level, you cannot revert back
    to the previous level.

6.  In the popup window, click **Request Upgrade**.

7.  Read the Managed Operations Terms of Service, select the **I agree
    to the Cloud Terms of Service** check box, and then click **Request

Get quick answers to common questions about Rackspace Managed Cloud
service levels.

#### What are the Rackspace service levels?

The Rackspace public cloud has two service levels in public cloud:
Managed Infrastructure and Managed Operations.

-   Managed Infrastructure: Rackspace manages the data center,
    infrastructure, and the virtualization layers.
-   Managed Operations: Rackspace manages the data center,
    infrastructure, virtualization layers, operating system, database
    layer, and web server.

#### What is the service-level pricing model?

The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total
cloud expense by separating the cost of infrastructure and support.

The infrastructure rate is based on the number of gigabytes (GB) of random
access memory (RAM) used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of
server. This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers.

The support cost, or Service Level Rate, is determined by the total Compute
power used. The Service Level Rate covers the maintenance and support of all
your cloud Compute products (such as servers), and is based on your service
level. OnMetal servers have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM. If you do not
meet the minimum Service Level Rate during your billing cycle, the difference is
assessed to your account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level Rate is
only assessed against Compute products. Storage services such as Cloud Files and
Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates associated with them.

#### Can new public-cloud customers choose other service levels?

No, new customers can choose *only* between Managed Infrastructure or
Managed Operations. Customers with the previous pricing model can stay
on that model or they may choose to move to the new pricing model.
Customers cannot return to the old model after they upgrade to Managed
Infrastructure or Managed Operations service levels.

#### What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?

Customers who have the Infrastructure Service Level will be
grandfathered into their current pricing plan and will continue to
receive the same support as always, along with the enhancements that
we're announcing.

#### Is Rackspace improving the support experience?

Yes, we are always looking at ways to improve our support. We expect
that our pricing changes will cause some new customers who don't value
support to choose other providers. As a result, we will be able to shift
more resources to serve customers who do value support and are willing
to pay for it.

#### What support guarantees do customers receive with Managed Cloud?

**Support SLA**: A service level agreement (SLA) that covers support
circumstances within our control.

-   Credit percentage: Standard rate is 5 percent per every 30 minutes
    of downtime, up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend.



**2x SLA Accelerator Credit percentage**: For Managed Operations service
level customers, we will double the credit percentage of all applicable
SLA violations.

-   Credit percentage: 2x up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend. For
    example, if the standard payout is 5 percent per 30 minutes of
    downtime, Managed Operations will be 10 percent per 30 minutes.
-   This 2x accelerator also applies to Support SLA credit payouts.



**10x SLA Accelerator Credit Payout for Planned Events for Managed
Operations.** Limited availability and subject to certain restrictions.

-   Managed Operations customers who, in preparation for a high traffic
    event, undergo a Rackspace led architecture review and meet the
    minimum requirements are eligible for this SLA.
-   The customer must notify Rackspace at least 30 business days prior
    to the planned event. We provide recommendations that the customer
    institutes, than the customer signs a program agreement.
-   Credit payout: 10x up to 200 percent of monthly spend (up to one
    event per month). For example, if the standard payout is 5 percent
    per 30 minutes, it will become 50 percent per 30 minutes up to
    200 percent.

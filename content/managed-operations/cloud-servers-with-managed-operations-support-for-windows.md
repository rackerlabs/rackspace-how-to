Managed Operations provides support beyond Managed Infrastructure,
including direct assistance with resizes, snapshots, host machine
issues, adding and removing servers, and managing IP addresses. To
ensure Fanatical Support, Rackspace provides support for specific
software and server configurations on Cloud Servers with Managed
Operations.

### Operating systems

operating systems for Windows cloud servers:

### Other packages

<span>While we do not support all technologies, we do offer reasonable
endeavor support which extends our support into offering alternative
solutions. The reasonable endeavor support can include help from Rackspace partners and other
third party services.

-   **Load Balancing** - Support is provided through the use of Cloud
    Load Balancers.

-   **Email** - Support is provided through Rackspace Email and using
    IIS SMTP on the server. Cloud Servers with a Managed Service Level
    are pre-configured to use our mail relay service Mailgun to ensure
    reliable mail delivery. The first 50,000 emails sent each month are
    free, and your mail package can be upgraded if higher volume
    is expected. For more details see our [Mailgun Rackspace pricing
    page](http://www.mailgun.com/rackspace).

-   **DNS** - The use of the Rackspace Cloud nameservers for DNS
    is supported. Windows DNS is currently not supported.

-   **Exchange** - Exchange is not supported at this time.

-   **SharePoint** - SharePoint is not supported at this time.

-   **Terminal Services** - We will install the role and license.

-   **Cloud Files** - Integration with Cloud Files is supported via the
    API, however no development assistance will be offered in
    utilization via the API.

### End of life support dates

Rackspace makes every effort to align our support dates for operating
systems with the manufacturer's support dates. The 'end of life' support
dates listed are provided by the manufacturer and are subject to change.
Should the manufacturer decide to shorten the support life of an
operating system, Rackspace may be forced to end support sooner than the
published date.

| Operating System Name | End of Life Support Date |
--------------------- | ------------------------ | 
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | January 14, 2020 |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | January 10, 2023 |

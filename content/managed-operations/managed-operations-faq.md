### Security

#### Are cloud servers PCI-DSS compliant?

The Rackspace Cloud environment has not been formally assessed for for
compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard
(DSS). For information about PCI-DSS, see [Cloud Security
Solutions](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/are-cloud-servers-pci-dss-compliant/). For
information about PCI-DSS when using Rackspace Dedicated Hosting
services, see [PCI-Compliant Hosting for E-commerce
Websites](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/pci/).

### General

#### Do you have Servers with a Managed Operations Service Level in the UK?

Yes. For information, go to
[http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud/managed](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud-hosting/cloud-products/managed-cloud/).

#### How do I contact the Managed Operations Team?

You can contact the Managed Operations team via direct chat, a phone
call to 1-800-961-4454, or by submitting a ticket online. There are
links to all of these options on the Control Panel.

#### As a Rackspace customer, can I link my Managed Hosting configuration and account to a Cloud Server with Managed Operations Service Level configuration and account?

Yes, the same way you are currently able to link your Managed Hosting
accounts and your cloud accounts.

#### Is there a cost associated with data migration services?

The Managed Operations team can help you determine if a migration is
needed. If it is, the Managed Operations team works with the Rackspace
Professional Services team on the migration, or they can recommend a
Rackspace Partner. Any work performed by the Rackspace Professional
Services Team or a partner incurs additional charges.

For more information, see [Rackspace Professional
Services](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/professional-services/).

#### Can I move my servers from my current account to a Managed Operations Service Level account?

If you want Managed Operations Service Level support for a server that
is in your current Managed Infrastructure account, you must migrate that
server to a new server within a Managed Operations account. This
migration is necessary in order for the appropriate OS images, patching
and updates, and system administration access provisions to be deployed
on the server. All of these features are necessary for the Managed
Operations team to provide you with the highest quality support for your
server. The Managed Operations support team will help you determine the
most efficient and effective way to migrate your Managed Infrastructure
server to a Managed Operations Service Level account.

#### Do I need a separate account for Cloud Servers with a Managed Operations?

Because the Managed Operations is offered at the account level, every
cloud product in the account receives the Managed Operations. Therefore,
if you want to have some cloud servers that do not have a Managed
Operations and some that do, you will need to have a separate account
for the Cloud Servers without Managed Operations. Servers on the other
account will be at the Managed Infrastructure Service Level.

#### What is Rackspace Cloud Backup?

Rackspace Cloud Backup is a file-level storage option for Cloud Servers.
It allows you to configure backups through the Control Panel and choose
to back up a particular folder or file with the frequency that works
best for you.

solutions.

#### What is included in a Managed Operations Service Level account?

Cloud Servers with a Managed Operations Service Level include access to
a dedicated, 24x7x365 support team via phone, chat, and online support
ticket. The team will support your servers from the OS up through the
application stack of Microsoft SQL Server, .Net/IIS, and the LAMP stack
on Linux. Your Cloud Server will be regularly patched and updated.
Monitoring services are included, with the Managed Operations team
proactively responding to any alerts. We will monitor up to two
user-defined ports as well as user-defined URL content.

We will provide free licensing for the Rackspace Cloud Backup file-based
backup option ( [standard Cloud Files storage fees

#### What is Cloud Servers with a Managed Operations Service Level?

Cloud Servers with a Managed Operations Service Level extends the
enhanced managed support level from our Managed Hosting offering into
our Cloud offering. The Managed Operations Service Level provides an
additional level of support that includes monitoring, OS and application
infrastructure layer support, and technical guidance for your Cloud
Servers.

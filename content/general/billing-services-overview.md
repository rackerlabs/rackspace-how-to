This article provides an overview of the billing resources available to you through the Rackspace website and the Cloud Control Panel. The resources described in this article can help you manage and track the billing for your account.

When you use Rackspace Cloud products, you pay only for the services that you use, with one exception: your cloud servers and load balancers are billed for uptime as long as they remain in the active status, even if they are not being used. This time is billed because these resources have been allocated for your exclusive use and cannot be reserved by other customers.

Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day that you activate your account, and your bill reflects services used in the previous month. If your usage begins in the middle of a billing cycle, your first bill reflects a partial month but is presented on your scheduled bill date.

### Pricing pages and cost calculator

Each product page on the [main Rackspace website](https://www.rackspace.com/) contains the most current pricing for that product, and a cost calculator to help you estimate your monthly charges. For example, see the [pricing information for Cloud Servers](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/pricing).

### Access your account information

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the control panel, click your user name.

    The menu gives you access to billing and payments, and a usage overview.

### View current usage

From the user name menu, select **Usage Overview**.

The balance-to-date is displayed for the Rackspace products that you are using. The message **No usage data** is displayed for the products that you are not using.

### View billing and payment information

From the user name menu, select **Billing and Payments**.

The Billing & Payments page shows your recent billing activity, current balance, billing history, and payment information. You can also change your billing and payment information from this page.

### View invoice details

In the **Billing History** section of the Billing & Payments page, click an invoice ID number to view the date of the invoice, the amount charged, and summarized charges for services. You can also download your invoice in PDF or CSV format for easy printing.

To view a more detailed invoice that shows an itemized, per-service, per-device overview of your billing charges, click the **Detailed View of Charges** link. For more information, see [Detailed invoices overview](/how-to/detailed-invoices-overview/).

If you are unable to find the information that you need in the Cloud Control Panel, or if you need more detailed billing and payment information than what is available on these pages, contact the Billing Support team for any billing questions. The team is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST, toll-free at 877 934 0410 or internationally at 1 210 581 0410. You can reach the Cloud Accounts Receivable team toll-free at 800 480 2716 or internationally at 1 210 312 4000.


### Reclaim VAT

If you're a VAT-registered business or organization, in most cases you can reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) that you pay when you buy goods and services for your business. To reclaim this money, you must have records to support your claim. By collecting your VAT ID number, Rackspace can correctly prepare an invoice for your records.

If you're not a VAT-registered business or organization, you can't reclaim the VAT that you pay when you buy goods and services.

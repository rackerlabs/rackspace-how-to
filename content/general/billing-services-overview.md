This article provides an overview of the billing resources available to you through the Rackspace website and the Cloud Control Panel. The resources described in this article can help you manage and track the billing for your account.

When you use Rackspace Cloud products, you pay only for the services that you use, with one exception: your cloud servers and load balancers are billed for uptime as long as they remain in the active status, even if they are not being used. This time is billed because these resources have been allocated for your exclusive use and cannot be reserved by other customers.

Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day that you activate your account, and your bill reflects services used in the previous month. If your usage begins in the middle of a billing cycle, your first bill reflects a partial month but is presented on your scheduled bill date.

### Pricing pages and cost calculator

Each product page on the [main Rackspace website](https://www.rackspace.com/) contains the most current pricing for that product, and a cost calculator to help you estimate your monthly charges. For example, see the [pricing information for Cloud Servers](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/pricing).

### Accessing your account information

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the control panel, click the **Billing**
   button.

    You are redirected to the **Billing Overview** dashboard, which provides information on billing, payments, and usage.

### Viewing current usage

The center panel of the **Billing Dashboard** displays your **Charges to date**. For a more detailed breakdown of the charges, click **View** in the section header.

The balance-to-date for the Rackspace products that you are using is displayed.

Click the arrow to the right of the dollar amount to see the details of your usage in type, unit price, and quantity, as well as an estimated total.

**Note**: This page only displays the Rackspace Cloud usage that you accrued
after your last invoice was generated. Usage accrues throughout the month, and
totals update on a daily basis. Some products and services may take up to 24 hours to appear on this page. Additionally, some charge totals only appear after applicable discounts are applied.

### Setting a billing threshold

The billing threshold option enables you to receive a notification if usage
meets or exceeds the amount you specify. When this occurs, Rackspace emails
the primary contact and the billing contact.

To enable this functionality, click the **Set Billing Threshold** link.

### Viewing invoice details

To access detailed information for your most recent invoice, go to **Billing
History > Invoice Details**.

Your most recent invoice opens in a detailed view.

Line items appear under the **Total Charges** section. To expand a line item,
click the down arrow to the left of the item description.

If there are per-device charges associated with a line item, a **Devices**
area appears within it. To expand this area further and display the cost
associated with each device, click the down arrow to the left of **Devices**.

You can download an invoice in PDF or CSV format. Click the **PDF** link or the
**CSV** link at the top-right corner of the screen.

To view past invoices, select a different date from the **Bill Date** menu
that appears in the navigation pane on the left.

### Managing payment methods

You can add or delete a payment method by navigating to **Payment Methods >
Manage Payment Methods**.

Your current payment methods are displayed.

To add a new payment method, click the **Add Payment Method** button and
follow the prompts.

To delete an existing payment method, click the gear icon that appears to the
left of the payment method, then select **Delete Payment Method**.

To change the default payment method, click the gear icon next to the method
you want to make the default, then select **Set as Default**.

If you're unable to find the information that you need in the Cloud Control
Panel, or if you need more detailed billing and payment information than what
is available on these pages, contact the Billing Support team for any billing
questions. The team is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
CST, toll-free at 877 934 0410 or internationally at 1 210 581 0410. You can
reach the Cloud Accounts Receivable team toll-free at 800 480 2716 or
internationally at 1 210 312 4000.

### Updating billing information

To modify basic billing information from the **Billing Overview** dashboard,
such as your billing address or contact:

1. In the header of **Billing Settings** section, click the **View** link.
2. Click the pencil icon next to the section you want to edit.
3. Make your changes, then click Save or Update to save them, or Cancel to
   discard them.

### Reclaiming VAT

If you're a VAT-registered business or organization, in most cases you can reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) that you pay when you buy goods and services for your business. To reclaim this money, you must have records to support your claim. By collecting your VAT ID number, Rackspace can correctly prepare an invoice for your records.

If you're not a VAT-registered business or organization, you can't reclaim the VAT that you pay when you buy goods and services.

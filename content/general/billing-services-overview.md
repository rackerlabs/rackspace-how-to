This article provides an overview of the billing resources available to you through the Rackspace website and the Cloud Control Panel. The resources described in this article can help you manage and track the billing for your account.

When using Rackspace Cloud products, you pay only for the services that you use. Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day that you activate your account, and your bill reflects services used in the previous month. If your usage begins in the middle of a billing cycle, your first bill reflects a partial month but is presented on your scheduled bill date.

**Note:** Your cloud servers and load balancers are billed for uptime as long as they remain in the active status, even if they are not being used. This time is billed because resources have been allocated for your exclusive use which cannot be reserved by other customers. The exception to this is Cloud Sites, which is billed in advance.

### Pricing pages and cost calculator

Each product page on the main Rackspace website contains the most current pricing for that product, along with a cost calculator to help you estimate your monthly charges. For example, see the pricing information for Cloud Servers.

### Access your account information

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/pricing/).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click **Account:** ***yourUsername***.

    The menu gives you access to billing and payments, and a usage overview.

The balance-to-date is displayed for the Rackspace products that you are using. The message **No usage data** is displayed for the products that you are not using.

The Billing & Payments page shows your recent billing activity, current balance, billing history, and payment information. You can also change your billing and payment information from this page.

### Detailed invoices

In the Billing History section of the Billing & Payments page, click an invoice ID number to view an account invoice in detail. You can see the date of the invoice, amount due, and itemized charges for services. You can also download your invoice in PDF or CSV format for easy printing.

If you are unable to find the information that you need in the Cloud Control Panel, or if you need more detailed billing and payment information than what is available on these pages, contact the Billing Support team for any billing questions. The team is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST, toll-free at 877 934 0410 or internationally at 1 210 581 0410. You can reach the Cloud Accounts Receivable team toll-free at 800 480 2716 or internationally at 1 210 312 4000.

The next article in this series reviews other resources available from the **Account** menu, including managing your contact information and your API key.

Instead of paying all of your Rackspace bills separately, you can combine your bills from multiple accounts into a single invoice, so you only have to pay once. This article describes how to combine invoices, how your billing due date is affected, and how to separate a combined invoice.

### Combine invoices

1. For Cloud accounts, log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/). For Managed accounts, log in to the [MyRack portal](https://my.rackspace.com/).
2. Click on your account name in the upper-right corner of the pate, and then click **Billing Overview**.

   You are redirected to the Rackspace Billing portal.

3. Click **Billing Settings** from the top navigation bar.

   A list of all accounts currently included in your invoice are displayed under the Invoiced Accounts section.

4. Click **Add Account to Invoice**.

5. On the Add Account screen, enter the account number that you want to add to the invoice, and then enter the username and password for that account.

6. Click the checkbox to agree to the terms of service, and then click **Add Account**.

   A pop-up dialog box displays and confirms the account information that you want to add to the invoice. Click **Add Account** to confirm.
   
After the accounts are consolidated, the Invoiced Accounts section of the **Billing Settings** page displays the new account. 

### Billing cycle

If your combined invoice includes on Rackspace Cloud accounts, then you will receive your next invoice on your normal bill date for your master account.

If your combined invoice includes a Rackspace Managed account, then your next invoice will be billed on the first day of the month. The following example describes how your billing is affected when combining Cloud and Managed account invoices:

- The Managed account is the master account with a billing date of 02/01, and the Cloud account's billing date is 02/15.
- Combined invoicing is requested on 02/20.
- On 03/01, an invoice is generated for only the master account.
- On 03/15, no invoice is generated for the Cloud account.
- On 04/01, the combined invoice is generated with all Managed and Cloud charges, including the owed Cloud account amount from 02/15 to 04/01.
- From this point on, the combined invoice is billed on the first of the month.

**Note**: If your Cloud account has discounts applied to it, they are prorated for the period during which no bill is generated.

### Separate a combined invoice

To separate a combined invoice, you must contact the account manager to update your billing preferences.

### FAQ

**What types of bills can I combine?**

Currently, you can combine bills from Rackspace Managed and Rackspace Cloud accounts. You cannot combine accounts that are billed in different currencies, are already combined with another invoice, or are of a different account type than Managed or Cloud.

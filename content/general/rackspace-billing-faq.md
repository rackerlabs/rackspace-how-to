Get quick answers to common questions about Rackspace billing.

### General

#### How am I billed for Rackspace services?

Many of our services follow a utility pricing model and are billed for
hourly usage each month on the anniversary date of the account creation.
Charges on invoices are based on service usage since the last invoice
date. Details about our product pricing are located on our [Cloud Pricing Page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public-pricing/).

Payments are charged automatically to a credit card.

#### How can I estimate my monthly bill?

You can use our [Cloud Pricing Page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public-pricing/) and [Cloud Pricing Calculator](http://www.rackspace.com/calculator/) to estimate pricing.

#### Can I pay in advance?

If you meet the minimum requirements for our Commitment Pricing Program, you can 
prepay based on a commitment pricing contract for your account. Any usage beyond the minimum 
commitment amount is invoiced at the utility rate on the monthly date of your
account's anniversary. For example, if your account was created on the 25th of the month, 
you will be billed monthly on the 25th. You can find more information about the Commitment Pricing
Program on the [Cloud Servers Discount page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/discounts/).

### Charges

#### What are the separate charges and minimums that are applied to Cloud Servers pricing?

The listed prices for Cloud Servers include both *raw
infrastructure* and *managed service* charges. The price is split to
show what you are paying for when you partner with us.

-   The raw infrastructure price can be contrasted with what other
    hosting companies charge for a cloud server. It covers the
    infrastructure of the hosted server.
-   The managed service price applies to the ***Fanatical Support***&reg;
    that we offer on top of our infrastructure. This *Service Level
    Rate* varies based on the service level that you choose for your
    cloud account.

The Service Level Rate *minimums* are based on the service level that you
choose for your cloud account. The minimums represent the minimum
monthly charge for the service. If the cost of the resources that you use in
a month exceeds the minimum, the Service Level Rate minimum does
not apply. If your costs for a month are less than the minimum, the
difference between your usage costs and the Service Level Rate minimum
are added to your bill.

#### Why am I being billed for a service when I'm not using it?

Billing begins the moment that you provision a service or server on your
account. You are charged for servers and services as long as their
resources remain allocated to your account, even if they are not in use
or are disabled. After you delete the server or service from your
account, its resources are available for someone else to use, and you are no
longer billed for them.

You can delete cloud servers and services by using the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com). To cancel Rackspace support for Azure, create a ticket for our billing team.

#### How do I delete or cancel my services?

Cloud accounts can be closed by the account owner at any time, but Rackspace cannot 
perform this action. Instead, the account owner must initiate the closure through the MyCloud portal, 
using the following steps: 

1. Ensure that all products (such as Cloud Servers, Images, Cloud Files, Cloud 
Block Storage, and so on) are deleted. 
2. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/), and
review all services to ensure that all your data is backed up outside of
the Rackspace environment. 
3.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click **Account**.
4.  Click **Account Settings** from the menu.
5.  At the bottom of the Account Settings page, click **Cancel My Account**.
6.  Choose a reason from the provided list.
7.  Check the check box at the bottom of the page.
8.  Type the word "CANCEL" into the text box.
9.  Click **Cancel Account**.

Cancellations cannot be initiated over the phone or with a support ticket. The cancellation
submission is your authorized approval for Rackspace to delete your account and
cancel your services in their entirety.  If you do not 
have a copy of your data outside of our Cloud infrastructure, Rackspace is not liable for data loss.

**Note:** Your Rackspace cloud account is billed one month in arrears on your anniversary date. 
Depending on the date on which your cancellation is finalized, you might still receive an 
additional, final invoice on your next invoice date. Refer to your billing overview 
for your monthly invoice date.

If you prefer to keep your account open without receiving future charges,
you can manually delete all services from your account profile. This
method enables you to use the Rackspace services in the future without
the need to register a new account.

#### I don't agree with my bill. How can I dispute a charge?

You can create a ticket via the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) with the details of your dispute. One of our account managers will review the ticket. A credit is granted only if there is an error related to our billing system or there is a service error according to your service level agreement (SLA).

When you sign up for products under the Managed Infrastructure or Managed
Operations SysOps service level, your credit card is charged a US $1.00 authorization charge to confirm that it is an active card. The authorization charge returns to your card normally within 24-72 hours.

Thirty days after you sign up, your first invoice is processed. Your
charges consist of service usage accrued within the first 30 days.

After the first billing cycle, you are billed every month on the same
date that you first signed up for service. If you have any questions
about account billing, call 1 877 934 0410.

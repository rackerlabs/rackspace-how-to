When you sign up for products under the Managed Infrastructure, Managed
Operations SysOPs, or Managed Operations DevOps Automation service
levels, your credit card is charged a US $1.00 authorization charge to
confirm it is an active card. The authorization charge returns to your
card normally within 24-72 hours.

Thirty days after you sign up, your first invoice is processed. Your
charges consist of service usage accrued within the first 30 days.
**Note:** The exception is Cloud Sites, which charges for the first 30
days at sign up and continues to charge in advance of monthly usage.

After the first billing cycle, you are billed every month on the same
date that you first signed up for service. If you have any questions
about account billing, call us at 1-877-934-0410.

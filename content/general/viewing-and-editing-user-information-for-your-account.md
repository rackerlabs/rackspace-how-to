This article provides a closer look at the services available on
the **My Profile & Settings**, **Account Settings**, and **User Management** pages in the Cloud
Control Panel. You access these pages from the user name menu located
in the top-right corner of the control panel.

### My Profile & Settings

Use the My Profile & Settings page to view your primary contact information, view or edit your security settings, and view your account and product permissions.

Use the **Security Settings** section to change your password, enable or disable multi-factor authentication, configure a secret question, and view your API key.

### Account Settings page

Use the Account Settings page to view your account settings, account details, product preferences, and to view or edit your primary contact information.

In the **Rackspace Account Settings** section, you must have multi-factor authentication enabled before you can edit the settings. To enable multi-factor authentication, click on your username in the upper-right corner and click **My Profile & Settings**.

In the **Primary Contact Information** section, you can view or edit your primary contact information, such as name, address, and phone number.

You can cancel your account by clicking **Cancel My Account** at the bottom of the page.

### User Management page

Use the **User Management** page to edit user-related information, such
as email addresses and passwords, and to add new users.

-   To make changes for a user, click the gear icon next the user name
    and select one of the options. Complete the
    applicable fields in the resulting pop-up dialog box and save
    the changes.

-   To add a new user, click **Create User**. On the **Create
    User** page, enter information for the new user's login, access
    levels, and contact information. For information about access
    controls for new users, see [Learning about Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/how-to/overview-role-based-access-control-rbac).
    After you have entered all of the information for the new user,
    click the **Create User** button at the bottom of the page.

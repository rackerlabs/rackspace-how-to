This article outlines the Rackspace **Fanatical Experience®** for network and
server configurations for virtual and physical machines that run a
supported operating system. The article presents a high-level overview of
changes to Rackspace alert monitoring offerings. Contact Rackspace Sales
or your account representative for more information regarding the components
of specific features that are supported in Rackspace offerings.

### What is changing

Rackspace has been hard at work to bring you AIOps powered improvements
to its event processing system. These improvements are now ready for
production and bring the value of event correlation to Rackspace’s
monitoring system.

The new improvements provide the following additional features to Rackspace’s
monitoring system:

- Identification of whether an alert is isolated to a single device
	or multiple devices
- Improved alert routing to the Rackspace team best suited to
	provide support
- Enhanced alert reporting via “situation” notices, which
	aggregate related alerts into a single notification

### Why

Rackspace is constantly seeking to improve its event processing system to
reduce resolution time, decrease ticket noise, and create a better
overall customer experience.

### What is AIOps

Rackspace is using deterministic clustering algorithms which create
situations defined by the relationships between alerts. Situation creation
is based on sets of filters, triggers, and other calculations such
as priority ordering.

### Change details

**MyRacksapce RNS notifications and Alert Tickets**

- Alerts will be grouped into correlated situations.
- A Rackspace support ticket will be created for each situation.
- Situations might contain one or more alerts.
- Individual alerts notifications will be sent to Rackspace Notification
  system along with for each situation ticket created.

### Situation ticket information

Alert grouping logic checks the alerts for applicable situation groups.
Situations are created for single alerts or multiple alerts when an alert
is correlated to an event with other alerts from the same device
or additional related devices.

|	Group	|	Situation Name	|	Notes	|
| --- | --- | --- |
|	​RS Situation - Infrastructure | Situation for Data Center | Group alerts together across multiple accounts based on a common data center level issue. |
|	​RS Situation - Infrastructure | Situation for devices located together DC | Group alerts together across multiple accounts based on a common cabinet and row level issue. |
|	RS Situation - Account level | Situation for custom monitor alerts per tenant | Groups account-unique custom monitoring alerts from the same account together. |
|	RS Situation - Account level | Situation for custom monitoring device alerts per tenant | Groups alerts originating from a common "Custom Monitoring Device" type device together. |
|	RS Situation - Account level | Situation for generic alerts per tenant | Groups alerts together based on the monitoring agent declaring it as "generic". |
|	RS Situation - Multidevice | Situation for associated devices | Groups alerts of the same class (ie. Availability, Hardware, Capacity, Performance, etc.) together based on the alert's origin device have common connected devices as those of another alert. |
|	RS Situation - Multidevice | Situation for clustered devices | Groups alerts together with common cluster devices. |
|	RS Situation - Multidevice | Situation for ping associated alerts | Groups "ping" alerts from within the same account together. |
|	RS Situation - Multidevice | URL-Port-Ping failures and connected device alerts from | Groups "Rackspace Monitoring" availability monitoring alerts from within the same account together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | Alerts with the same classification (type) | Groups alerts of the same type (ie. "RS Alert - Cluster", "RS Alert - SQL", "RS Alert - AD", etc.) originating from the same device together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | Alerts with similar descriptions | Groups alerts with similar descriptions (ie. "Local file system [PATH] is not available", "The [DRIVE_LETTER] on computer [DEVICE] is running out of disk space", etc.) originating from the same device together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | Alerts with similar names | Groups alerts with similar names (ie. "Filesystem Inaccessible", "Network Bonding", "Cluster Service Stopped", etc.) originating from the same device together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | Situation for performance and capacity alert per device | Groups alerts belonging to the Performance (ie. CPU, Memory, etc.) and/or Capacity (ie. Low Disk, database out of space, etc) classes originating from the same device together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | MBU alert grouping | Groups Managed Backup alerts originating from the same device together. |
|	RS Situation - Device level | Remaining identical alerts | Alerts meeting no other grouping criteria are collected in Situations of one alert until such a time as further alerts arrive matching another Cookbook Recipe. |

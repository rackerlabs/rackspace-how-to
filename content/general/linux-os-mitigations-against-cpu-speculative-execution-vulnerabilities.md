Rackspace continues to evaluate and address a set of speculative execution vulnerabilities affecting certain CPU processors, commonly known as Meltdown and Spectre: [CVE-2017-5753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753), [CVE-2017-5715](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715), and [CVE-2017-5754](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754).

Kernel updates to mitigate specific variants of the exploits on the supported Linux速 distributions at Rackspace (Red Hat速 and CentOS速 6.7+ & 7.3+; Ubuntu速 14.04 & 16.04 LTS) has been released. For additional information on these patches, see [https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution) and [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown).  

**Note**: This update might impact performance to an extent dependent upon specific workloads. Red Hat has provided information regarding potential performance impacts at [Speculative Execution Exploit Performance Impacts](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3307751).

Servers must be rebooted to apply the new kernel. At this time, Rackspace does not intend to force reboots of customer servers. For those customers who want to apply the update, Rackspace can install the new kernel and reboot servers immediately. Alternatively, Rackspace can install the new kernel and customers can schedule the reboots to occur in the future via the following methods:

- Dedicated Physical Server: MyRack Customer Portal [https://my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com) -> Services -> Reboot Scheduling

- VMware&reg;  Virtual Server and Managed Operations Rackspace Public Cloud Servers: Supply the date, time, and time zone. Rackspace will schedule an automated reboot on behalf of the customer. 

Operating systems listed as End of Life (EOL) by the vendor might not receive patches. For those configurations that run an older EOL operating system including (but not limited to) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, CentOS 5, and Ubuntu 12 LTS, Rackspace recommends that customers upgrade to a supported version.

Customers on managed cololocation (colo) or Managed Infrastructure Rackspace Public Cloud environments should reference the vendors for their recommended solutions to mitigate the vulnerability via patches of the operating system.

Further remediation might be necessary as evaluation of these vulnerabilities continues.


As always, please contact your support team if you have any questions.

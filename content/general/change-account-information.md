This article describes the various administrative account changes that you can request and the appropriate steps needed to complete them. 

### Company under new ownership or tax ID

If the ownership of your company or the company's tax ID has
changed, you must complete the **Service Transfer** form. This form requires signatures from
both the assignor (original account owner) and the assignee (new account owner).

You can download the **Service Transfer** form directly from
the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) by using the following steps.

**Note:** If you are a Dedicated Hosting customer, you can request this form
directly from your Account Manager.

1.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click your username, and then click **Documents and Forms**.
2.  In the **Rackspace Account Change Forms** section, click the **Service Transfer** form link.
3.  Download the **Service Transfer** form and complete it.
4.  Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit the ticket.

### Company name change

If your company has filed for a name change with the Secretary of State
where the company is registered and there was a change in tax ID,
complete the **Service Transfer** form. See the preceding section for information about how to download and submit this form.

If the company name has changed but there was no change in tax ID or
ownership, you must complete one of the following forms to provide
evidence of the name change. These forms are available from the Secretary of State.

- Certificate of Name Change
- Certificate of Amendment

Attach the form to a support ticket with **Company Name Change
Request** in the subject line.

### New primary contact or billing information

If you have access to the account, you can update the primary contact
details in the **My Profile & Settings** section in the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com).

If you are not the primary contact, you must fill out the **Primary
Contact Change** form and submit it via a support ticket. You can download this form directly from the Cloud Control Panel by using the following steps:

1.  In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click username, and then click **Documents and Forms**.
2.  In the **Rackspace Account Change Forms** section, click the **Primary Contact Change Form** link.
3.  Download the **Primary Contact Change** form and complete it.
4.  Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit the ticket.

**Note:** The primary contact email address is used for all
account notifications and for regaining the credentials for access to an
account when the **I forgot my password** link is
used.

To update the billing information, including the billing address and the
credit card on file, go to the **Billing & Payments** section of the control panel by clicking your username in the upper-right corner, and then selecting **Billing and Payments**.

### Best practices for legal change forms

The forms described in this article have many required fields that must be
completed before the Billing team can process the forms. After you have
completed a form, scan the document and attach it to the support ticket
in the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com). Allow
two business days for the Billing team to review.

To avoid form rejection, use the following tips when completing the
form:

-   The signatures on the **Service Transfer** form *must* come
    from an officer or an owner of the company.
-   The owner or officer must initial any changes regarding an increase
    in MMR or added devices or domains that are made to the form after
    the initial submission.
-   No blank fields are allowed on any form, except where indicated. You
    may not type **Same** in any field

### Service Transfer form requirements

The Billing team has strict requirements when processing the
**Service Transfer** form for a Rackspace account. Use the
following information to have the submission processed quickly and
efficiently.

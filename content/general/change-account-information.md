This article describes the various administrative account changes that you can request and the appropriate steps needed to complete them.

**Note:** If you are a Dedicated Hosting customer, you can request all of the forms described in this article from your account manager.

### Service transform form requirements

The Billing team has strict requirements for processing the Service Transfer form for a Rackspace account. Use the following information to have the submission processed quickly and efficiently.

**Page 1 - Account details**

-   **Transferring Customer / Assignor** - Provide the current account information.
-   **Accepting Customer / Assignee** - Provide the new account information.

**Page 2 - Signatures**

-   Signatures *must* be from the owner or an officer of the company. No
    exceptions are allowed.
-   **Transferring Customer / Assignor** - Provide the signature of the
    current primary contact on the account.
-   **Accepting Customer / Assignee** - Provide the signature of the new
    contact or the existing contact if that is not changing.

Do not fill out the **RACKSPACE US, INC.** section. A Rackspace
representative completes this section.

**Page 3 - Consolidated and/or Linked Cloud Accounts (Exhibit A)**

In the **Cloud Account Number** and the **New Cloud Account Name** columns, provide the following information:
  -   **Cloud Account Number** - Enter the account number.
  -   **New Cloud Account Name** - Enter the new name of the account. Leave
        this blank if there is no change.

### Best practices for legal change forms

The both the service transfer and primary contact transfer forms have many required fields that must be
completed before the Billing team can process the forms. After you have
completed a form, scan the document and attach it to the support ticket
in the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com). Allow
two business days for the Billing team to review.

To avoid form rejection, use the following tips when completing the
form:

- The signatures on the **Service Transfer** form *must* come
  from an officer or an owner of the company.
- The owner or officer must initial any changes regarding an increase
  in MMR or added devices or domains that are made to the form after
  the initial submission.
- No blank fields are allowed on any form, except where indicated. You
  cannot type **Same** in any field.

Change is a regular part of business. This guide describes the various
administrative account changes that we can assist you with. Review the
different types of change requests and the appropriate steps needed to
complete them.

### Company under new ownership or tax ID change

If the ownership of your company has changed or the company's tax ID has
changed, you must inform us of these changes by completing the
**Assignment and Assumption form**. This form requires signatures from
both the assignor (original account owner) and the assignee (new account
owner).

You can download the **Assignment and Assumption** form directly from
the Cloud Control Panel by using the following steps:

1.  From the **Account** menu, select **Account Settings**.
2.  In the **Account Details** section, click the **Documents
    and Forms** link.
3.  Complete the **Assignment and Assumption** form.
4.  Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit.

If you are a Dedicated Hosting customer, you can request this form
directly from your Account Manager.

### Company name change

If your company has filed for a name change with the Secretary of State
where the company is registered and there was a change in tax ID,
complete the **Assignment and Assumption** form.

See the preceding section for information about obtaining and
submitting this form.

If the company name has changed but there was no change in tax ID or
ownership, you must complete one of the following forms to provide
evidence of the name change:

-   **Certificate of Name Change**
-   **Certificate of Amendment**

Attach these forms to a support ticket with **Company Name Change
Request** in the subject line.

### Primary contact on account change

If you have access to the account, you can update the primary contact
details in the **Account Settings** section in the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com).

If you are not the primary contact, you must fill out the **Primary
Contact Change** form and submit it via a support ticket.

You can download this form directly from the Cloud Control Panel by
using the following steps:

1.  From the **Account** menu, select **Account Settings**.
2.  In the **Account Details** section, click the **Documents
    and Forms** link.
3.  Complete the **Primary Contact Change** form.
4.  Attach the completed form to a support ticket and submit.

**Note:** The primary contact email address is used for all
account notifications and for regaining the credentials for access to an
account when the **I forgot my password** link is
used.

To update the billing information, including the billing address and the
credit card on file, go to the **Billing & Payments** section.

### Best practices for legal change forms

The forms described in this guide have many required fields that must be
completed before the Billing team can process the forms. After you have
completed a form, scan the document and attach it to the support ticket
within the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com). Allow
two business days for the Billing team to review.

To avoid form rejection, use the following tips when completing the
form:

-   The signatures on the **Assignment and Assumption** form *must* come
    from an officer or an owner of the company.
-   The owner or officer must initial any changes regarding an increase
    in MMR or added devices or domains that are made to the form after
    the initial submission.
-   No blank fields are allowed on any form, except where indicated. You
    may not type **Same** in any field

### **Assignment and Assumption form requirements**

The Billing team has strict requirements when processing the
**Assignment and Assumption** form for a Rackspace account. Use the
following information to have the submission processed quickly and
efficiently.

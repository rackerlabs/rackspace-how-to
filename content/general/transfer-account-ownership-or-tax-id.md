If the ownership of your company or the company's tax ID has
changed, you must complete the **Service Transfer** form. This form requires signatures from both the assignor (original account owner) and the assignee (new account owner).

You can download the **Service Transfer** form directly from
the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) by using the following steps.

**Note:** If you are a Dedicated Hosting customer, you can request all of the forms described in this article from your account manager.

**Note:** Before completing the service transfer form, read the "Best practices for legal change forms" section of [Change account information](/how-to/change-account-information).

1. In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click **Account** > **Docs and Forms**.
2. Select the **Rackspace Account Change Forms** section.
3. In the **Transfer Ownership to a new Account owner** section, select one of the following options:

   - If you are a Fanatical Support for AWS customer, download the **Fanatical Support for AWS Service Transfer Form**.
   - All other customers, download the **Service Transfer Form**.

4. Fill out the downloaded form and save the edited file on your local machine.
5. In the Cloud Control Panel, select **Tickets** > **Create Ticket**.
6. In the category section, set **Type** to **Account** and **Account Update**.
7. Fill out the details for your ticket and attach your saved account change form to your ticket.

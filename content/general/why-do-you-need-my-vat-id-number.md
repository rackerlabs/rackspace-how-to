If you're a VAT-registered business, in most cases you can reclaim the
VAT you pay when you buy goods and services for your business. In order
to reclaim this money you need to have records to support your claim. By
collecting your VAT number, Rackspace can correctly prepare an invoice
for your records. If you're not a VAT-registered business or
organization then you cannot reclaim the VAT you pay when you purchase
goods and services.

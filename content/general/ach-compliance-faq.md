Automated Clearing House (ACH) is an electronic network used in the
United States for financial transactions. It is regulated by the
National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and handles
electronic check payments. This FAQ answers questions about changes that
Rackspace is making to our ACH process and how those changes affect
customers.

#### Why are you changing your policy?

For Rackspace to comply with NACHA regulations, we need to make the
following changes to our ACH process:

-   Record your agreement to the Terms and Conditions that authorizes
    ACH payments
-   Provide you with the ability to cancel automatic ACH payments
-   Pre-authorize your checking account to confirm that the account
    exists, and store the pre-authorization information

#### Where do I go to access or view my payment information?

Log in to the MyRack Portal. Click **Account**, and then select
**Payments** from the menu.

#### Where do I go to re-enter my ACH payment information?

On the Payments page in the MyRackspace Portal, click **Recurring
Payments** at the top of the screen. Update your payment information in
the fields on the **Direct Debit / E-Check** tab.

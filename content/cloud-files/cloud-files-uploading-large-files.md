For large files support, Cloud Files allows you to upload multiple file
segments and a manifest file to map the segments together.

Following are a few limitations:

-   Files larger than 5 GB must first be segmented into smaller files.
-   We recommend that you do not create file segments smaller than
    100-200 MB.
-   Files larger than 10GB cannot be served from the CDN.

There are two options for uploading large files.

### Automatically Segment & Upload

The Swift Tool will segment your large file for you, create a manifest
file, and upload them accordingly,  After the file has been uploaded
this tool manages your file segments for you, deleting and updating
segments as needed.  It will look like this:

    $ st -A https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0 -U glh -K 3a25c2dc74f24c3122407a26566093c8 upload -S 1048576 test_container largefile.iso
    largefile.iso segment 1
    largefile.iso segment 6
    largefile.iso segment 9
    largefile.iso segment 4
    largefile.iso segment 5
    largefile.iso segment 3
    largefile.iso segment 7
    largefile.iso segment 8
    largefile.iso segment 2
    largefile.iso segment 0
    largefile.iso

### Use the API with your Application

You can use the Cloud Files API to incorporate large file support
directly into your application. Here is a simple cURL example of how you
can use the API:

    # First, upload the segments
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \     http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/1 --data-binary '1'
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \     http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/2 --data-binary '2'
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \     http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/3 --data-binary '3'

    # Next, create the manifest file
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
    -H 'X-Object-Manifest: container/myobject/' \     http://<storage_url>/container/myobject --data-binary ''

    # Then you can download the segments as a single object
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
    http://<storage_url>/container/myobject

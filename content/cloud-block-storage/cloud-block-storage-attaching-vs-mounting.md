In Cloud Block Storage you both attach and mount a Volume to a Server.
These terms might sound similar, so it can get confusing as to their
differences.

**Attach:** When you attach a Cloud Block Storage Volume to a server, a
logical connection is created from a Cloud Block Storage node to the
hypervisor hosting your cloud server. This is done over a network link
via the iSCSI protocol. The new Volume gets exposed as a virtual device
to the host. To your Cloud Server, the Volume appears as a new raw
storage device. Attaching a Cloud Block Storage Volume can be
accomplished via the API or through Control Panel.

**Mount:** Mounting is generally done once a volume has been attached
and formatted for use by a computer's operating system. Mounting is the
process in which a user instructs the operating system how to logically
map the directory structure to a physical storage device. You can only
mount a volume through the computer's operating system.

For more information on how to mount your volume, see [Prepare your
volume](/how-to/prepare-your-cloud-block-storage-volume).

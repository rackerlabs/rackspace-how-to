[Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by
Openstack](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/openstack) allows you
to install an OpenStack private cloud, configured as recommended by
Rackspace OpenStack specialists.

Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by OpenStack uses Ansible to create an
OpenStack cluster on Ubuntu Linux. The installation process provides a
familiar approach for Linux system administrators, and the environment
can be updated easily without downloading and installing a new ISO.

The current versions are

-   Rackspace Private Cloud v11, based on OpenStack Kilo ([Release Notes](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/private-cloud/rpc/v11/rpc-releasenotes/))

-   Rackspace Private Cloud v10, based on OpenStack Juno ([Release Notes](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/private-cloud/rpc/v10/rpc-v10-releasenotes-external/))
    ([Installation Guide](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/))

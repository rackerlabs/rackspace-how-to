### Using sosreport

Before you begin to use `sosreport`, log into the node with the OS
username and password that you created during the installation process.
Once you are successfully logged in, use <span class="command">**sudo
-i**</span> to switch to root access.

#### Generating a report

To generate a basic report with default settings, run the command on the
command line:

``` {.screen}
$ sosreport
```

You will be prompted to confirm that you want to generate the report.
Press **Enter** to continue.

At the prompt, enter your first initial and last name. If you have been
assigned a case number by your Rackspace support representative, enter
it at the prompt.

``` {.screen}
Please enter your first initial and last name [ctrl]: jdoe
Please enter the case number that you are generating this report for: 1234
```

When the report is complete, the utility will display a message showing
you where the report `tar.xz`{.filename} file has been saved and the
checksum for the report.

``` {.screen}
Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
  /tmp/sosreport-jdoe.1234-20120907125725.tar.xz

The checksum is: acfcceaa72242483edece9e3b97687f1
```

You can now send the `.tar.xz`{.filename} file to Rackspace Support.

If required, you can run `sosreport` with additional reporting options.
For example, the **--diagnose** option
includes diagnostic options, and the **--report** option generates an html-formatted
list of the files copied in the report. Include additional options if
requested by Rackspace Support.

#### sosreport plugins

Depending on your issue and the instructions of Rackspace Support, you
may need to disable or enable certain plugins when the report is
generated. To view a full list of the plugins, use **sosreport -l**. The output will be similar to
the following example.

``` {.screen}
root@ctrl:~# sosreport -l

### Install Outlook for Mac 

Prior to starting, ensure that your device is on Mac OS x 10.10 or later, as this is a requirement to utilize Office for Mac 2016.

When you install Outlook for Mac, there are two options available: a company or personal product key or an Office 365 license that includes a downloadable version of the Office Suite.

If you have a company or personal product key, navigate to the link below, select the appropriate language, and then select **Download**:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45492

1.  After the download has completed, open **Finder > Downloads**, and then double-click **Microsoft_Office_2016_Installer.pkg**.

2.  On the first installation screen, select **Continue** to begin the installation process.

3.  When prompted, enter your Mac login credentials to complete the installation process.

4.  Finally, enter your product key.

If you have an Office 365 license which includes a downloadable version of the Office Suite, use the following steps:

**Note:** If you aren't sure if your license includes the Office suite, contact your administrator.

1.  In a web browser, navigate to office.com, and then **Sign-In** with your Office 365 email address and password.

2.  After you sign in, navigate to **Settings**, and then **Office 365 Settings > Software**

3.  On the **Software** page, select **Install** under **Install Office 2016 for Mac** to begin the download.

4.  After the download completes, open **Finder > Downloads**, and then double-click **Microsoft_Office_2016_Installer.pkg**.

5.  On the first installation screen, select **Continue** to begin the installation process.

6.  When prompted, enter your Mac login password to complete the installation.

### Configure your Office 365 mailbox for use with the Outlook for Mac desktop client

Use the following steps to setup your Office 365 mailbox within the Outlook for Mac desktop client:

1.	Start Outlook for Mac.

2.	Under the **Tools** menu, select **Accounts**.

3.	Click the **+** sign in the lower-left corner, and then select **New Account**

4.	Enter your Office 365 email address when prompted, then select **Continue**

5.  Finally, enter your Office 365 mailbox password when prompted to complete the setup process.  

### Troubleshooting

If you have previously configured your Office 365 mailbox for use in the Outlook for Mac desktop client, yet you continue to receive password prompts, use the following steps:

1.	Verify your credentials by attempting to login at office.com with your Office 365 email address and password.

2.	Clear old entries from the **Keychain Access** for Mac, as Outlook might be attempting to authenticate with an old password. For more information, see (Clear keychain access for Mac)[/how-to/clear-keychain-access-for-mac].

In the event that you are **Unable to Connect to the Server**, attempt the following steps:

1.  Verify that you have a functioning network connection.

2.  Verify that autodiscover has been configured correctly for your domain. For more information, see (Create DNS records using Windows-based DNS)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/dns/create-dns-records-using-windows-based-dns?view=o365-worldwide].

3.  Contact your administrator to see if multi-factor authentication has been enabled for your organization.

### Basic Functions in Outlook

Now that Outlook is configured for use with your Office 365 mailbox, we'll go over a few basic functions within the application itself.

**Composing a new message:**

1.  Within Outlook, select **New Email**, and once composed, hit **Send**

**Adding an email signature:**

1.  In a new message, select **Signature**, and then **Signatures**

2.  Within the **Email Signature** tab, select **New**

3.  After completing your signature, assign a name to the signature, and then select **Ok**.

4.  After the signature is created, you can configure how you want the signature to be used (on new emails, replies, and so on) under **Choose default signature**.

**Replying to an email:**

1.  Select the email you want to reply to, and then choose **Reply** or **Reply to All**

2.  After the email has been composed, select **Send**

### Getting started

#### Where do I access my Office 365 account?

Your account is separated in two different locations:

-   You manage your Office 365 services at
    [portal.office.com](http://portal.office.com). From here you can
    create new users and work with Exchange, Skype for Business,
    SharePoint, Yammer, and the rest of the Office 365 suite.
-   You manage your Office 365 Rackspace account at either
    [my.rackspace.com](http://my.rackspace.com) or
    [cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com). From here you can
    handle account administration, open chat support, create support
    tickets, and pay your bill.

#### What are the system requirements to run Office 365?

You can find up-to-date system requirements for Office 365 on the
[Microsoft support
website](https://support.office.com/client/What-hardware-and-software-do-I-need-4349bb87-531e-4ee9-8019-1d19dfab3a5a?ui=en-US&rs=en-NZ&ad=NZ&fromAR=1).

#### Do I need to have an installed email client to use Office 365?

A stand-alone email client is not needed for Office 365. However, many
Office 365 plans have the option of using an Office suite, which would
include Outlook. We recommend that you use the most up-to-date version
of Outlook to ensure the most complete experience.

For a list of features supported by Office 365, go to the [Outlook
website](http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/cc511379.aspx).

#### Does Office 365 support IMAP, POP, and SMTP connections?

You can use IMAP and SMTP connections instead of the default MAPI-based
connection that comes with Office 365. If you choose to use an IMAP or
SMTP connection, functionality outside of email will be reduced.

#### What ports does Office 365 use for IMAP, POP, and SMTP connections?

For IMAP:

-   Incoming server - outlook.office365.com : Port - 993

For POP:

-   Incoming server - outlook.office365.com : Port - 995

For SMTP:

-   Outgoing server - smtp.office365.com: Port - 587

#### What information do I need to provide to get started?

You need to provide the following information when signing up for Office
365:

-   Your custom domain
-   Your domain name registrar login and password
-   Your DNS hosting provider login and password
    Your DNS records are usually managed by the registrar from which you
    bought your domain name, but sometimes the DNS records are managed
    by a different company. If you don't know where your domain is
    registered or where the DNS records for your domain are managed, you
    can use a [WHOIS
    search](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-your-domain-registrar-or-DNS-hosting-provider-b5b633ba-1e56-4a98-8ff5-2acaac63a5c8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)
    to find the information that you need.
-   A list of people to add to Office 365
    Unless you are the only person in your company, you will want to add
    other people to Office 365 so that they can use the service. If you
    are working with our [onboarding/migrations
    team](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/migration), this will be
    covered directly during the migration process.

#### Can I add my domain to Office 365?

Yes. You can find instructions about how to do so on the [Office 365
support
website](https://support.office.com/en-za/article/Verify-your-domain-in-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611?ui=en-US&rs=en-ZA&ad=ZA).

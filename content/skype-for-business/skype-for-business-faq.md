### Account Services

#### Why am I having audio problems?

If there&rsquo;s a problem, a notification is displayed in the conversation
window or the Skype for Business main window. You can click the
notification for more information or suggested solutions.

If you&rsquo;re not getting sound, check that:

-   Your speakers are turned on, both in Skype for Business and your
    computer, and the speaker volume is high.
-   Your telephone handset is on the cradle (if you&rsquo;re getting audio
    through a phone).
-   The device you&rsquo;re using is selected on the **Devices** tab, (pause
    on the phone/mic icon and click the **Devices** tab).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### General

#### How do I prevent Skype for Business from starting automatically every time I log in to Windows?

1.  From the Skype for Business main window, select
    **Options &gt; Personal.**
2.  Uncheck the box labeled **Automatically start Skype for Business
    when I log on to Windows**. The next time you log on, if you want to
    use Skype for Business you&rsquo;ll need to select it from the Start menu.

#### How do I confine Skype for Business to the task bar until needed?

1.  From the Skype for Business main window, select
    Options &gt; Personal.
2.  Uncheck the box labeled **Show Skype for Business in the foreground
    when it starts**.
    The next time you log on, the Skype for Business icon will appear on
    the task bar at bottom of your screen. You&rsquo;ll need to select it to
    open the Skype for Business main window.

#### How do I keep my Skype for Business conversation window visible?

Select the drop-down button next to the Options icon, select **Tools**,
and then select **Always on Top**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Contacts

#### What does the red star or asterisk next to a contact's status mean?

The red asterisk next to a contact's status indicates that he or she has
turned on the Out of Office reply in Outlook.

#### Why does the Relationships view of my Contacts list include people I didn't personally add, and how do I remove them?

Every contact you interact with via Microsoft Office, whether in your
Skype for Business contacts list or not, has a "default" relationship
with you. Your &ldquo;unlisted&rdquo; contacts (that is, those who are not included
in your Skype for Business contacts list) don&rsquo;t get displayed in either
the Groups view or the Status view. But the Relationships view shows all
the contacts on your Skype for Business contacts list *plus* any
unlisted contacts whom you&rsquo;ve assigned a non-default privacy
relationship.

To remove any of these &ldquo;unlisted&rdquo; contacts from your Relationships view,
right-click on the contact, click **Change Privacy Relationship**, and
select **Auto-assign Relationship**.

#### How do I turn off all pictures in Skype for Business, including my own?

Select **Options &gt; Personal** , then clear the check box labeled
**Show pictures of contacts** .

This will remove pictures from your contacts list. It will also
eliminate pictures of sender and receiver from IM and group
conversations, and it will remove your own picture from Skype for
Business as well.

#### How many contacts can I have?

The default maximum number of contacts that can be added is 1000. But
your actual limit is set by your support team, so contact them if it
seems you&rsquo;ve hit your limit or if you&rsquo;re not sure what it is in your
organization.

#### How do I create a group?

1.  In the Skype for Business main window, on your Contacts list,
    right-click any group name (for example, **Other Contacts** ), then
    click **Create New Group** .

    Or, click **Add a Contact** and then select **Create a New Group**.

2.  In the space that now opens up at bottom of the window, type over
    the phrase *New Group* to give your group a descriptive name.

#### How do I organize my contacts by location, department, or other criteria?

Create a new group based on the category you need. For instance, you
might create a group called &ldquo;Headquarters staff&rdquo; and add contacts to
that group.

#### How do I get added to or removed from a list of delegates?

Depending on your authorization within your organization, there are two
methods of modifying deligate lists.

-   To be added to or removed from a delegate list, you need to ask the
    owner of the list to make the change. The delegate lists are created
    and maintained by each Skype for Business user.
-   To create or revise your own delegate list, click the **Options**
    button on the Skype for Business main window, click **Call
    Forwarding** , and then click the **Edit my delegate members** link
    at bottom of the window. A dialog box will open where you can add,
    remove and/or change the permissions of delegates.

#### How do I delete contacts from my Contacts list?

Right-click the contact you want to delete, and then click **Remove from
Contacts List**.

#### How do I display only those contacts who are online?

Although you can&rsquo;t completely remove offline contacts from your contacts
list, you can send them to a separate group so they don&rsquo;t clutter it up.

Click **Options-&gt;Contacts List** and then select the checkbox labeled
**Show contacts with away, offline and unknown presences in a separate
group**. Unavailable contacts will now appear at the bottom of the
display, in a group called Away and Offline Contacts.

#### How do I block contacts from reaching me via Skype for Business?

**Note**: Although your name and email address are displayed to blocked
contacts, they can&rsquo;t reach you through Skype for Business.

To block a contact in Skype for Business:

-   Right-click the contact you want to block.
-   Click Change Privacy Relationship.
-   Select click **Blocked Contacts**.

#### How do I find contacts within my organization?

In the **Search** field on the Skype for Business main window, type the
name, email address, or phone number of the person for which you are
looking.

#### How do I add an internal contact to my Contacts list?

1.  In the Skype for Business main window, click **Add a Contact**.
2.  From the dropdown menu, select **Add a Contact in my Organization**.
3.  In the search box, type the person&rsquo;s name, email alias, or phone
    number.
    As you type, a list of people who match the search terms
    is displayed.
4.  Scroll through the search returns list until you come to the person
    you want to add to your Contacts list. Right-click the person&rsquo;s
    search listing, and then click **Add to Contacts List** .
5.  Select a group from the list to which to add your new contact.

#### Can I automatically add everyone in the domain to my Skype for Business contacts?

No. Skype for Business does not have the ability to automatically add
all users in the domain to the contacts list. This is a limitation of
the Skype for Business product, and not a limitation imposed by
Rackspace. The limitation applies to all configurations, dedicated and
multitenant.

The basic premise is that you do not *want* to have every employee in
the whole company in your list. You create smaller groups composed of
the people with whom you work closely, and then you add other groups or
individuals to your contact list as needed.

#### Within Outlook how do I turn off Online Status for contacts?

Within Outlook 2010 or 2013, go to
**File**&gt;**Options**&gt;**People**.

At the bottom of the page you will see a section called **Online status
and Photographs**. Deselect the two boxes there and restart Outlook.

By turning off the option **Show user photographs when available** will
turn off photos in contacts all together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Instant Messages

#### Can I recall (block the delivery of) an IM?

No, an instant message can&rsquo;t be recalled once you hit the Enter key to
send it.

#### How do I disable IM alert sounds?

You can instruct Skype for Business not to play your audible IM and/or
phone alerts whenever your presence says Do not Disturb, and you can
further instruct Skype for Business to notify you only if the person
trying to contact you is a member of your workgroup with that privacy
relationship.

To view and adjust these settings:

-   Click the **Options** button in the Skype for Business main window,
    and then click **Alerts** .

To turn the audible alerts off altogether:

-   Click the **Options** button in the Skype for Business main window,
    click **Ringtones and Sounds** , and then clear the **Play sounds in
    Skype for Business (including ringtones for incoming alerts and IM
    alerts)** check box.

#### How do I set an alert to notify me as soon as a particular contact becomes available?

In the Skype for Business main window, in your Contacts list,
right-click a contact, and then click **Tag for Status Change Alerts**.

#### How do I change fonts in my IMs?

To change the font, style, size or color for a specific IM you are
writing:

-   Type your message, highlight the text you want to change, click the
    **Font** button in the IM composing area, and then make your
    selections in the Font window.

To change the default font details for all the IMs you send:

-   From the Skype for Business main window, click the **Options**
    button, click **General** , click **Change Font** , and then select
    a default font, font style, font size, and font color. Then click
    **OK** . These selections will apply only to IM messages you send,
    not to those you receive.

To change the default font details for incoming IMs as well (to improve
their legibility, for example):

-   From the Skype for Business main window, click the **Options** button,
    click **General** , click **Change Font** , and then select a default
    font, font style, font size, and font color. Then select the **Apply
    settings to incoming messages** checkbox, and then click **OK**.

#### Can I add customized emoticons to my Skype for Business IMs?

No, you can&rsquo;t. But, there are 80 emoticons in the Skype for Business
assortment. To see them, click the emoticon icon to the right of the
text input area on the conversation window.

#### Can I use spell checking in my Skype for Business IMs?

Yes, Skype for Business checks your spelling automatically. Skype for
Business won&rsquo;t mark as misspelled any word that you&rsquo;ve added to your
Office custom dictionary. To turn off spellchecking in Skype for
Business, click the Options button, then click **General** and clear the
**Check spelling as I type** check box.

#### What types of information can I copy and paste into an IM?

You can copy and paste text (formatted or unformatted), tables, and
links from other Microsoft Office products directly into a Skype for
Business IM. You can also copy and paste images (screenshots, photos,
etc.) directly into your IMs. Just select and copy the image (using
Paint, the Snipping Tool in Windows Accessories, or a graphics program),
then place your cursor in your IM where you want to add the graphic,
right-click, and select **Paste**.

#### Where can I find previous IM conversations, records of Skype for Business calls, or IM requests I may have missed?

By default, if you are using Microsoft Outlook, Skype for Business saves
all incoming and outgoing conversations in your Outlook's **Conversation
History** folder, so you can review previous conversations. To see a
list of recent Skype for Business interactions added to this folder:

-   On the Skype for Business main window, click the **Conversations**
    tab above the Search input area.

To see the entire folder:

-   Click the **View More in Outlook** link at bottom of the window.

**Note**: If your conversations are not being saved in this Outlook
archive, and you want to set up an archive for future conversations,
follow these steps:

1.  Verify that you are using Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013.
2.  In the Skype for Business main window, click the **Options** button,
    and then click **Personal**.
3.  Click the **Save instant message conversations in my email
    Conversation History folder** button, and then click **OK**.

Unless your Skype for Business administrator has set a policy to retain
all messages, you can also delete conversations from the Conversation
History folder.

#### How can I make the IM alerts more prominent so I don&rsquo;t miss incoming IM requests?

Unless you have set notifications so alerts will not display when you
are in Do not Disturb mode, Skype for Business will by default always
send you both a visual alert (in the lower right corner of your display)
and a sound alert whenever someone tries to reach you via IM. Just the
same, you may occasionally fail to notice an IM request. This is
especially likely when you are using multiple screens or when your alert
volume is too low or off.

To help ensure that your IM alerts are noticeable, try the following:

-   Set your display so Skype for Business is always in the foreground
    when it starts. To do this, click the drop-down next to the
    **Options** button, click **Tools**, and then click **Always on
    Top**.
-   If you use multiple screens, make a practice of moving your Skype
    for Business Main window onto the display monitor you are
    working on.
-   Confirm that the volume is turned up on your computer speakers and
    other audio device(s).
-   Confirm that Skype for Business is set to send audible alerts. To do
    this, click the **Options** button, click **Ringtones and Sounds**,
    select **Play sounds in Skype for Business (including ringtones for
    incoming calls and IM alerts)** , and confirm that the other check
    boxes in the panel are not selected.
-   Consider choosing a more distinctive or more prominent alert sound
    than the default to notify you of an incoming message. To do this:

1.  Click **Options**&gt; **Ringtones and Sounds**&gt;**Sounds
    Settings** and then click the **Sounds** tab.
2.  Drag the slider on the Program Events display panel down to the
    Microsoft Skype for Business listings.
3.  Click **Incoming Instant Message**. The **Sounds** display at bottom
    of the window should read **COMMUNICATOR\_iminvite**.
4.  Click the drop-down arrow next to **COMMUNICATOR\_iminvite** to
    sample some of the other sounds on the list. *(Optional)* You can
    also record your own .wav file for this purpose, and then browse to
    that file to select it as your IM alert.
5.  Select the sound you want to use for incoming IM alerts, and then
    click **Apply**.
    The Program Events display panel should now read **Incoming Instant
    Message** and the Sounds panel should display the name of the .wav
    file you selected.
6.  Click **OK**.

### User Status

#### What do the various presence states mean, which ones are set automatically, and which ones can I set myself?

Following is a table that describes the contact presence states that
people can see, what each state means, and how it gets set.

| Presence/Status      | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Available            | You're online and available to contact. Automatic or user-selected setting.                                                                                                |
| Busy                 | You're occupied and shouldn't be interrupted. Automatic (if user is in an Outlook-scheduled conference) or user-selected setting.                                          |
| In a call            | You're in a Skype for Business call (two-party call) and shouldn't be interrupted. (Automatic)                                                                             |
| In a conference call | You're in a Skype for Business call (Skype for Business meeting with audio) and shouldn't be interrupted. (Automatic)                                                      |
| Do not disturb       | You don't want to be disturbed and will see conversation notifications only if they are sent by someone in your Workgroup. (User-selected)                                 |
| Presenting           | You are giving a presentation from your Skype for Business-enabled computer or are otherwise sharing your desktop and are not to be disturbed. (Automatic)                 |
| Be right back        | You're stepping away from the computer for a few moments (User-selected)                                                                                                   |
| Away                 | Your computer has been inactive for a period of time (5 minutes by default; value can be adjusted). (Automatic)                                                            |
| Off work             | You're not working and not available to contact. (User-selected)                                                                                                           |
| Offline              | You're not signed in. If you have blocked individuals from seeing your presence, you'll appear offline to them. (Automatic)                                                |
| Unknown              | Your presence is not known. If others are not using Skype for Business as their instant messaging (IM) program, your presence might appear as unknown to them. (Automatic) |

#### How can I give people more information about my status?

Although the presence states in Skype for Business are pre-set, you can
always write a personal note at the top of the Skype for Business main
window to provide more details about where you are and what you&rsquo;re
doing. Just click the note display area and type over the note that&rsquo;s
currently displayed.

#### What do the settings on the Status options window mean?

On the Status options window you can change the number of minutes that
elapse before your presence status changes to **Inactive** and **Away**
, if you don&rsquo;t want to use the default settings. You can also have Skype
for Business automatically detect when you are sharing information from
this computer. Skype for Business will set your status as Presenting and
block others from sending messages to you during that time.

To set these presence status options:

1.  In the Skype for Business main window, click the **Options** button,
    and then click **Status** .
2.  Click the up and down arrows to specify the number of minutes before
    your presence status changes to **Inactive** .
3.  Click the up and down arrows to specify the number of minutes before
    your presence status changes to **Away** .
4.  Click the appropriate button to control general status (override
    default settings or accept them), and then click **OK** .

Select the checkboxes labeled **S how me as Do Not Disturb when I
present my desktop** and **Show me as Do Not Disturb when my monitor is
duplicated** to let others know not to interrrupt you when you are
giving a presentation or otherwise collaborating online from your Skype
for Business-enabled computer.

#### Why can&rsquo;t I set my presence status to "Appear Away"?

Your organization may have turned off the Appear Away status option, on
the grounds that it can interfere with the reliability of the presence
indicator. If a lot of people use this status constantly, presence in
general won&rsquo;t mean much. Keep in mind that you can also use privacy
relationships to avoid interruptions. For example, if you don&rsquo;t want to
be disturbed by most people, you can set your status as Do Not Disturb
and then grant certain people permission to interrupt you by adding them
to your Workgroup.

#### How do I get rid of the Out of Office note in Skype for Business?

If your Skype for Business account is synced via Microsoft Exchange
Server to your Outlook calendar, an out-of-office message appears in
Skype for Business after you turn on the Out of Office reply in
Microsoft Outlook. To get rid of the out-of-office message display in
Skype for Business, you need to turn off the Out of Office reply in
Outlook:

-   Click the **File** tab in Outlook, and then click the **Turn off**
    button in the Automatic Replies panel.

**Note**: It may take several minutes for the message to disappear in
Skype for Business.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Audio and Video

#### What is Enterprise Voice? (Currently Not Available)

Enterprise Voice provides enhanced calling options, such as call a
contact, hold, forward, transfer, voice mail, conferencing, simultaneous
rings, enhanced 9-1-1 calling, and calls to and from the public switched
telephone network (PSTN).

-   **Phone tab** provides a list of voice mails and call logs, as well
    as an on-screen dial pad for dialing a number.
-   **Skype for Business Call** computer to computer calls with
    one click.
-   **Audio Quality** quickly places a test call to check the quality of
    your audio.
-   **Call delegation** supports features such as shared lines (making
    and receiving calls on behalf of a manager), transferring calls to a
    manager and managing calls.
-   **Call Quality Notification** provides notifications to help you
    improve the quality of your call if it detects device, network, or
    computer issues during the call.
-   **Device transfer** enables you to switch your audio device during
    a call.
-   **Calls to and from PSTN** sends and receives calls from numbers on
    the public telephone systems, outside your company.
-   **Call Park** holds a call on one phone, and then retrieves the call
    from another phone.
-   **Device Selection** receives incoming calls simultaneously on all
    your communications devices, enabling you to answer with whichever
    device is most convenient.
-   **Integration with Exchange Unified Messaging** provides voice mail,
    voice messaging, email messaging, call answering, subscriber access,
    call notification, and auto-attendant services.
-   **Emergency Services- 911** provides location information to
    dispatchers of emergency services, (available for North
    America only).
-   **Simultaneous ringing** enables incoming calls to ring on
    additional phones, for example, cell phones or other devices.
-   **Call forwarding** enables you to forward calls to other phones,
    such as your cell phone or home phone.

#### What can I do to improve device audio quality?

The following guidelines will improve device audio quality.

-   Use a high quality audio device, replace any defective or damaged
    devices, and run the set up to make sure it works correctly. We
    recommend you use a device listed in [Phones and Devices for Skype
    for
    Business](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn947482.aspx) .
-   It&rsquo;s important that a noise-canceling microphone is positioned close
    to the mouth, approximately less than 1 inch away from the mouth, to
    filter out unwanted background noise.
-   Most headsets have a button to adjust the volume depending on which
    audio device the headset is connected to. If you or other callers
    hear a buzzing noise, make a test call and then adjust the settings
    on the headset until the buzzing noise is gone.
-   If you&rsquo;re using the speaker on your phone and callers complain about
    background noise, make sure that the phone is on a flat surface, and
    you are close to the phone.
-   If you&rsquo;re using two separate devices for audio (such as desktop
    speakers and camera), try to place them at an appropriate distance
    from each other to minimize echo.
-   We recommend that you don&rsquo;t make calls over a wireless connection,
    virtual private network (VPN), or remote access service (RAS)
    connections.

#### Can I use Skype for Business to make a call?

A **Skype for Business call** is made from your computer to someone
else&rsquo;s computer who is also using Skype for Business (computer audio).

Yes, there are two ways to call others with Skype for Business:

-   A Skype for Business call placed to a contact rings all their
    devices that are enabled for Skype for Business, such as desktop and
    laptop computer.

-   You can also make Skype for Business calls to federated contacts. A
    federated relationship with other companies is just a virtual
    alliance that lets you add users from other companies to your
    contacts lists, send them IMs, make audio, video and conference
    calls, and exchange presence information.

#### How do I know my devices are set up correctly?

Skype for Business automatically detects your audio and video devices.
However, we strongly recommend that you check before making a call or
joining a meeting, to make sure they are set up correctly.

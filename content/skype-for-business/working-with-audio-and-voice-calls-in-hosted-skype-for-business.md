When you use Hosted Skype for Business at Rackspace, you can make and

-   Set up your audio device
-   Make an audio call
-   Answer an audio call

### Set up your audio device

Before you use Skype for Business to make or join an audio call, set up
your audio device and check the quality. You can use your computer&rsquo;s
microphone and speakers, or you can use a headset or earphones.

1.  In the lower-left corner of the Skype for Business main window,
    click the **Select Your Primary Device** icon, and select **Audio
    Device Settings** from the menu.

2.  Click the **Select the device you want to use for audio** calls
    menu, and select the device that you want to use.

3.  In the **Customize your device** section, drag the sliders to adjust
    the volumes of the speakers and microphone.
    -   To hear a sample tone, click the green arrow for the speaker.
    -   Adjust and test your microphone, using the blue indicator to
        help you choose the appropriate level. If you are using a
        handset, speak into the receiver. If you are using a headset,
        speak into the microphone.

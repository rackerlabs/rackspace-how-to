This page presents several common relational databases and NoSQL databases.

### Popular relational databases and RDBMSs

The following list describes popular SQL databases and RDBMSs:

- **Oracle**: An object-relational DBMS written in the C++ language.
- **IBM DB2**: A family of database server products from IBM.
- **Sybase**: A relational database server product for businesses that is
  primarily used on the Unix operating system (OS).
- **MS SQL Server**: An RDBMS for enterprise-level databases that supports both
  SQL and NoSQL architectures. MS SQL Server was developed by Microsoft.
- **Maria DB**: An enhanced, drop-in version of MySQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: An enterprise-level, object-relational DBMS that uses
  procedural languages such as Perl and Python in addition to SQL-level code.

#### Popular NoSQL databases

The following list describes popular NoSQL databases:

- **MongoDB**: The most popular open-source NoSQL system. MongoDB is a
document-oriented database that stores JSON-like documents in dynamic schemas. Craigslist, eBay, and Foursquare use MongoDB.
- **CouchDB**: An open source, web-oriented database developed by Apache. CouchDB uses the JSON data exchange format to store its documents; JavaScript for indexing, combining, and transforming documents; and HTTP for its API.
- **HBase**: An open source Apache project that was developed as a part of Hadoop. HBase is a column store database written in Java. It has capabilities similar to those that BigTable provides.
- **Oracle NoSQL Database**: Oracleâ€™s NoSQL database.
- **Cassandra DB**: A distributed database that excels at handling extremely large amounts of structured data. Cassandra DB is also highly scalable. Cassandra DB was created at Facebook. It is used by Instagram, Comcast, Apple and Spotify.
- **Riak**: An open source, key-value store database written in Erlang. Riak offers excellent performance, due to built-in fault-tolerance replication and automatic data distribution.
**InfoGrid**: An open source web graph database with additional software components that make it easy to develop RESTful web applications on a graph foundation. It is being developed in Java as a set of projects.
**Infinite Graph**: A highly specialized graph database that focuses on graph data structures. InfiniteGraph is useful for finding hidden relationships in big data. It is implemented in Java.

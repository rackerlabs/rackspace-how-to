This series of articles provides an introduction to NoSQL databases, and explains the differences between NoSQL databases and relational databases. Databases of both types can be organized so that a database management system can access and pull specific information from them. The articles touch on commonly used relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Oracle Database and popular NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra.

These articles are intended to help you identify areas where you can best leverage RDBMS and NoSQL.

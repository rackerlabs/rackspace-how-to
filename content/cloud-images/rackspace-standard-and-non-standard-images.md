The [Rackspace Cloud Terms of Service](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos)
refer to standard and non-standard images. This article provides more detail about those terms.

### Standard Images

Standard images are all the base images supplied by Rackspace for your service level and RackConnect status that have not yet reached end of life status.

### Non-Standard Images

Any images that are not standard for your account's service level and RackConnect status are non-standard. The following images are considered non-standard images. Note that this list is not exhaustive.

-    All imported and exported images
-    All end of life Images
-    Any shared images that you receive
-    The boot.rackspace.com image and any customer-created images derived from it

### Support for Non-Standard Images

Any non-standard images are subject to Rackspace's Managed Infrastructure policies. Please see [Explanation of Rackspace service levels](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/service-levels/)for an explanation of Rackspace service levels.

### Pricing

Although there is no separate fee for using Cloud Images, you will incur indirect costs for underlying services that you use.

### How Can I Determine if an Image is Standard or Non-Standard?

Please see [Identifying Rackspace Standard Images](/how-to/identifying-rackspace-standard-images).

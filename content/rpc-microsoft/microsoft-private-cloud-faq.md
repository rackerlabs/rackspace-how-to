### What are the key features of Microsoft Private Cloud?

-   **Built on Microsoft Hyper-V** - Flexible guest VM support on
    private and secure hardware makes Hyper-V the hypervisor of choice
    for your workloads. Microsoft Cloud Platform builds on the Hyper-V
    Server platform by introducing automation, monitoring, and
    self-service provisioning.
-   **Self-service** - Windows Azure Pack: Manage your private cloud
    through an easy-to-use web interface that gives you self-service
    provisioning and control of virtual machines, websites, database as
    a service, and more.
-   **Cost-effective licensing** - Hyper-V comes free with Windows; no
    hypervisor licenses to buy. Our host server licensing allows
    unlimited Windows guest operating systems at no additional cost. And
    the price difference between Windows DataCenter edition and the
    Windows version that includes Microsoft Cloud Platform is minimal.
-   **Scalability** - Manage servers in other Rackspace data centers
    from a central portal; Connect and manage servers in your own data
    center; Burst out to public Azure.
-   **Database as a Service** - Enables DBaaS through the Windows Azure
    Pack, provision and manage Microsoft SQL Server&reg; or MySQL&reg; databases
    through a convenient web interface running on your dedicated,
    secure hardware.
-   **Storage spaces** - Leverage software defined storage as the data
    store for Microsoft Cloud Platform.

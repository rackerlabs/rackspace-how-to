The following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) describe how Rackspace
Private Cloud powered by Microsoft Cloud Platform can work for you.

#### What are the key features of Microsoft Cloud Platform?

-   **Built on Microsoft Hyper-V**: Flexible guest VM support on
    private and secure hardware makes Hyper-V the hypervisor of choice
    for your workloads. Microsoft Cloud Platform builds on the Hyper-V
    Server platform by introducing automation, monitoring, and
    self-service provisioning.
-   **Self-service**: Manage your private cloud through an easy-to-use
    web interface, supplied by Windows Azure Pack, that gives you
    self-service provisioning and control of virtual machines, websites,
    database as a service (DBaaS), and more.
-   **Cost-effective licensing**: Hyper-V comes free with Windows, so
    you don't need to buy any hypervisor licenses. Our host server
    licensing allows unlimited Windows guest operating systems at no
    additional cost. And the price difference between Windows Datacenter
    edition, and the Windows version that includes Microsoft Cloud Platform,
    is minimal.
-   **Scalability**: Manage servers in other Rackspace data centers
    from a central portal. You can connect and manage servers in your own data
    center, and burst out to public Azure.
-   **Database as a service**: The Windows Azure pack enables DBaaS, so that
    you can provision and manage Microsoft SQL Server&reg; or MySQL&reg; databases
    through a web interface running on your dedicated, secure hardware.

#### Why should I use Microsoft Cloud Platform?

-   **Backed by *Fanatical Support*&reg;**: Microsoft Cloud Platform
    includes full infrastructure support backed 24x7x365. Guest Virtual
    Machine (VM) support is available on your terms, and guest VMs are also
    supported.
-   **Expertise**: Rackspace is a four-time Microsoft Hosting partner of
    the year. We have hundreds of Microsoft Certified Professionals
    running thousands of Microsoft workloads every day.
-   **Scalability with availability**: Scale to thousands of nodes with
    the Windows Azure Portal, with built-in features such as live
    migration and failover clustering for up to 64 nodes.
-   **Security**: Get the enhanced security of a single-tenant
    environment with physically isolated network, compute, and
    storage layers. Additional hardware-based network security options
    are available.
-   **Flexible**: The Microsoft Cloud Platform is supported by all server,
    storage, and networking architectures at Rackspace. You can add
    hardware incrementally, connect across multiple data centers, connect
    and manage servers in your own data center, and burst out to the
    public Azure.

#### What are some use cases for Microsoft Cloud Platform?

-   **Core infrastructure**: Microsoft System Center is an ideal
    choice whenever seasonal spikes require additional power from your
    hardware reserves or Microsoft Azure.
-   **Application hosting**: Consisting of Microsoft SharePoint and
    Exchange, the Rackspace dedicated Cloud Office product is the
    ultimate application for the Microsoft Cloud OS platform.
-   **Web hosting**: You can host production, QA, and development
    environments on System Center with confidence.
-   **Database hosting**: System Centers, Windows Azure Pack, and either
    SQL Server or MySQL Server, deliver the essential environment to
    architect an enterprise-grade SQL database service, and
    private-cloud security is maintained. You can natively manage database
    servers through System Center or DBaaS.
-   **Disaster recovery** - The Microsoft virtualization stack provides for
    disaster recovery. Build out these critical environments by using known
    technologies, such as PowerShell and Windows Server, on a platform
    already licensed.

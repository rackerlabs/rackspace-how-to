Rackspace Cloud Orchestration support for RackConnect v3.0 is now available. This support enables you
to build a stack of RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers and have them
automatically provisioned on your RackConnect v3.0 cloud network,
assigned public IP addresses, and have them automatically added to your
dedicated load balancer pools. When you use Cloud Orchestration, the
RackConnect v3.0 API calls need to assign a public IP address to a cloud
server and add it to a load balancer pool are all handled by Cloud
Orchestration.

**Note:** Managed operations customers must
provide ServiceNet along with the RackConnect
network.

More details about Cloud Orchestration are available in the following documents:

-   [Quickstart for Cloud Orchestration - API
    v1.0](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/orchestration/getting-started/)
-   [Rackspace Cloud Orchestration Developer Guide - API
    v1](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-orchestration/v1/developer-guide/)
-   [Rackspace Cloud Orchestration Templates User Guide  - API
    v1.0](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/orchestration/)

Although an official RackConnect v3.0 heat template has not been
released yet, an in-development template is available on GitHub at
<https://github.com/rackerlabs/heat-ci/blob/master/dev/rackconnect.template>.

If you have the [heat
client](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-orchestration/v1/developer-guide/#using-the-heat-client)
installed, you can also get more details about the RackConnect specific
resources available with Cloud Orchestration by running the
`resource-type-show` commands as follows:

    heat resource-type-show "Rackspace::RackConnect::PoolNode"
    heat resource-type-show "Rackspace::RackConnect::PublicIP"

Following is an example of the parameter and resource entries that you
can use to create a RackConnect v3.0 Heat template. These entries create
a cloud server on a RackConnect v3.0 cloud network, add that cloud
server to a dedicated load balancer pool, and allocate a public IP
address to the cloud server.

    parameters:

      rcnet:
        type: string
        description: The uuid of the RackConnect network to use
        constraints:
        - custom_constraint: "rackconnect.network"
        default: "<RCv3_NETWORK_UUID>"

      rcpool:
        type: string
        description: The uuid or name of the RackConnect load balancer pool to use
        constraints:
        - custom_constraint: "rackconnect.pool"
        default: <LB_POOL_NAME_OR_UUID>

    resources:

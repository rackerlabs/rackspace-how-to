You can access the RackConnect Management Interface from the
[MyRackspace Portal](https://my.rackspace.com/). To view your
RackConnect configuration, click **Network &gt; RackConnect**.

On the RackConnect page, you can add a Cloud account to your RackConnect
configuration, view public IP addresses for your connected cloud
servers, set network policies for your cloud servers, and view the
progress of all automation.

The interface displays the servers on your RackConnect account with
colored status indicators.

The automated Orchestration feature is available as a convenience to
customers for the provisioning of Rackspace infrastructure and
installation of software in a recommended, best practice fashion.
Rackspace makes no representation or warranty, and does not provide a
service level agreement (SLA) for the Orchestration feature. Applicable
SLAs for the underlying infrastructure apply for successfully launched
cloud products.

Software that is installed using Orchestration is not supported or
maintained by Rackspace, unless otherwise specified.

Logos or names of third party applications are the property of the
respective owners and are used only as an indication of what is being
installed. Logos do not associate any affiliation between the third
party and Rackspace.

Service](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/tos).

Cloud Orchestration templates allow you to quickly and easily set up
server environments with different software configurations.

The list of templates expands frequently, so the best way to see every
template that is currently available is to log in to the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) and click **Orchestration**.

Alternatively, you can see a recent snapshot of the list of Cloud
Orchestration templates without logging in. That snapshot is included in
the Cloud User Guide under [Installing a software
stack](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/cloud-preprod/stack/).

**Cluster** A group of servers (nodes). In Cloud Big Data, the servers
are virtual.

**HDFS** The Apache Hadoop Distributed File System. This is the default
file system used in Cloud Big Data.

**MapReduce** A framework for performing calculations on the data in the
distributed file system. Map tasks run in parallel with each other.
Reduce tasks also run in parallel with each other.

**Node** In a network, a node is a connection point, either a
redistribution point or an end point for data transmissions. In general,
a node has programmed or engineered capability to recognize and process
or forward transmissions to other nodes.

**SCP Server Proxy** An SCP service that runs on your Hadoop cluster and
distributes your files across the cluster.

**Service Catalog** Your service catalog is the list of services
available to you, as returned along with your authentication token and
an expiration date for that token. All the services in your service
catalog should recognize your token as valid until it expires.

The catalog listing for each service provides at least one endpoint URL
for that service. Other information, such as regions and versions and
tenants, is provided if it is relevant to your access to this service.

**Tenant** A container used to group or isolate resources or identity
objects. Depending on the service operator, a tenant could map to a
customer, account, organization, or project.

This article describes how to monitor user storage in the Cloud Office Control Panel as well as best practices for mailbox storage.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time Needed:** 10 minutes
- **Tools Needed:** Administrators need access to their Cloud Office Control Panel, their mobile device, and a two-factor authentication application

With the methods available to compromise an account growing in both number and sophistication, properly managing password security is more important
than ever to ensure that your business is not compromised.


#### Control Panel Password Management

Access to the control panel is the key to the kingdom. Every precaution should be taken to prevent unwanted guests from accessing this powerful tool.

- Always set up Two-Factor Authentication.
- Consider setting restrictions such as for admin access such as [**Login restricted to IP addresses**](/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel/) or disabling [**Allow simultaneous logins using this Administrative ID**](/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel/).

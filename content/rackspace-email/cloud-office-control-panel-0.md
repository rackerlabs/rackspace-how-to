The Service Summary page in the Cloud Office Control Panel contains detailed information about the services on your account. You can cancel services on a per domain basis, if needed. If you want to downgrade a service, contact Support.

To cancel a service, [log in to the control panel](https://cp.rackspace.com), and perform the following steps:

1. At the top of the page, click your account name and then select **Upgrades & Services**.
2. On the **Upgrades & Services** tab, click **Service Summary**.

    **Note:** The **Service Summary** link might not be available for all customer types. Resellers should remove services through **Reseller Tools**.
3. Locate the service that you want to cancel, and click **Cancel Service** for that service.
4. Select a **Cancellation Date**. The default date is your next renewal.
5. Click **Submit Request**. You will receive a confirmation email.

    **Note:** You can review, edit, and revoke cancellations on the **Pending Cancellations** page.

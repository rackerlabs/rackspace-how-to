This article explains how to delete a Rackspace email mailbox in your Cloud Office Control Panel.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator

- **Difficulty:** Easy

- **Time needed:** Approximately 5 minutes

- **Tools required:**  Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).


Before deleting a mailbox, you should be absolutely certain that you do not need any of the data stored in the mailbox. If you do need data in the mailbox,
you must export the data before deleting the mailbox. Data exports must be performed through a [local mail client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology) such as Outlook.

### Delete vs. Disable

Disable a mailbox - This DOES NOT remove a mailbox from your account. It prevents access to the mailbox. If a mailbox is disabled it remains on your account
and you continue to be billed for that mailbox. The mailbox will still retain its previous data and will still receive new mail sent to it.

Delete a mailbox - Deleting a mailbox removes that mailbox and all of it's data from our servers. Once you have deleted a mailbox, you must contact support to have that
change reflected on your bill.

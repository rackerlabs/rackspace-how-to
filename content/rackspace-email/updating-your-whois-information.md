A domain's WHOIS record can include various types of information about each domain that you own. When a WHOIS search is performed, you can discover when and by whom a specific domain was registered, the domain contact information, and more. If Rackspace is your domain's registrar, you can manage your domain's WHOIS information through the
control panel, as described in this article.

**Note:** The information that you provide is visible to anyone who searches the Internet for your domain's WHOIS record.

1. [Log in to the Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. From the **Go to section** menu, select **Domains**.
3. In the **Manage** section, click **DNS Settings**.
4. Find the domain for which you want to manage WHOIS information, and click the **Edit WHOIS** link.
5. Make changes as needed and then click **Save**.

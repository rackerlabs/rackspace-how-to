If you are using Rackspace Email and are setting up your email software
(for example, Microsoft Outlook or Mac Mail), you must indicate whether
you want to receive email by using an IMAP or POP connection. IMAP is
generally the preferred method because it gives you complete access to
all email and all email folders, from multiple computers or mobile
devices. This article describes the differences between the IMAP and POP
mail protocols.

For Rackspace Email settings for both IMAP and POP, see [Rackspace Email
and Hosted Exchange
settings](/how-to/rackspace-email-and-hosted-exchange-settings).

**Notes:**

-   We strongly recommend using an IMAP connection with Rackspace Email.
-   Microsoft Exchange users normally access their mailbox data via the
    Exchange server rather than using a POP or IMAP connection.

### IMAP

When you check your email with an IMAP connection, you are accessing and
managing your email directly from the email server. Following are
some features of IMAP:

-   **Access:** Because emails are stored on the email server, you can
    access and manage your email and email folders from multiple
    computers or mobile devices.

-   **New Items:** IMAP uses "fetch" technology. When a new email
    arrives, your email client will fetch new messages at defined
    time intervals.

-   **Storage:** If you have limited online storage space, you might
    need to delete some emails periodically to avoid exceeding your
    storage capacity.

-   **Backup:** Email is automatically backed up every evening. If you
    accidentally delete an email, your email administrator can retrieve
    it, even up to 14 days later.

-   **Internet connection:** You must have an Internet connection
    to access your email.

**Note:** By default, email clients store your sent, draft, and trash
email on your computer, rather than storing it on the email server (as
it should with an IMAP connection). You might need to map your email
folders within your email client.

### POP

When you check your email with a POP connection, new email messages are
downloaded to your computer and are then deleted from the email
server. Following are some features of POP:

-   **Access:** Because your email is stored on your computer, you must
    be at your computer to access your email.

-   **New Items:** POP uses "fetch" technology. When a new email
    arrives, your email client will fetch new messages at defined
    time intervals.

-   **Storage:** You don't need to worry about running out of online
    storage space. Because emails are downloaded to your computer, you
    can keep as many emails as your computer can store.

-   **Backup:** You should implement an effective backup system for your
    computer, in case you need to retrieve lost or deleted emails.

-   **Internet connection:** You must have an Internet connection to
    download your email, but you can view your downloaded email offline
    (that is, without an Internet connection).

### Mobile Sync
### Test text - Mobile Sync is like Active Sync for non Exchange.
When you check your email using Mobile Sync, you are accessing and
managing your email directly from the email server using Microsoft
ActiveSync technology. Following are some features of Mobile Sync.

**Note**: This service is an additional fee and enabled by your email
administrator. For more information, see <http://www.rackspace.com/blog/mobile-sync-for-rackspace-webmail-take-your-webmail-with-you-anywhere>.

-   **Access**: Because emails are stored on the email server, you can
    access and manage your email and email folders from multiple
    computers or mobile devices.

-   **New Items:** Mobile Sync uses "push" technology. When a new
    email arrives, the email is pushed to your device instantly.

-   **Storage**: If you have limited online storage space, you might
    need to delete some emails periodically to avoid exceeding your
    storage capacity.

-   **Backup**: Email is automatically backed up every evening. If you
    accidentally delete an email, your email administrator can retrieve
    it, even up to 14 days later.

-   **Internet** **Connection**: You must have an Internet connection to
    access your email.

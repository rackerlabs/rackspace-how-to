  **Warning:** You cannot create a private webmail site using a site name that already exists, uses the root domain of mymailsrvr.com, or is listed on Google Safe Browsing.

6. You will be presented with instructions to update the DNS entry for your site with new information. Copy these instructions by clicking **Copy Instructions** before clicking **Ok, Got It**.

    - The DNS for most existing sites will be an A record that points to a specific IP address. You need to change the A record type to CNAME, and change the IP address to the hostname provided. For example, if your webmail site is going to be **mail.yourdomainexample.com**, you would change the hostname to **mail** or **mail.yourdomainexample.com**. The tables below illustrate this change.

        **Before DNS change:**

        |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
        |---|---|---|
        |A| @ | 000.00.000.00 |

        **After DNS change:**

        |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
        |---|---|---|
        |CNAME| mail| pl-10.admin.emailsrvr.com |

    - If your existing DNS record is already a CNAME, then just update the existing hostname to the new one provided.

        **Example DNS entry:**

        |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
        |---|---|---|
        |CNAME| mail| pl-10.admin.emailsrvr.com |

    **Note:** For specific instructions on editing your DNS records, please contact your DNS host. [Find your DNS host here.](/how-to/find-dns-host)

The site will now appear in the **Webmail Sites** listing. Once the DNS change is propagated it will have a green "locked" icon to the right of the name to show that the site is secure.

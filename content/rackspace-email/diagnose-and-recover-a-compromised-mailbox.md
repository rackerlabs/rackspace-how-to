This article describes steps to identify a compromised mailbox, stop the attack, and prevent future attacks.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User or administrator
- **Difficulty:** Moderate
- **Time needed:** Approximately 1 hour
- **Tools required:**  Users need their current password; administrators need Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).


#### Risk factors

1. You have started receiving bounce messages for emails that you never sent.
  - If you are receiving bounces for messages you never sent, it is likely that someone is sending messages from your mailbox without your consent.

2. You clicked a link without verifying it as authentic.
  - While this is vague it is important to always verify links before clicking them. If clicked a link without doing so, scan your computer for malware and change your mailbox password.

3. You received an email from Rackspace informing you that your mailbox has been disabled.


#### Recover a mailbox that has been compromised

1. Change the password to the mailbox immediately.

  - Locking out those who have compromised the mailbox is the top priority.

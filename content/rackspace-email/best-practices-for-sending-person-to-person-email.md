Sending person-to-person email is an integral part of our daily
activities, but it's getting harder to ensure that the mail you send
gets to the Inbox of the people you intended. Stricter and more
sophisticated spam filters flag more email than ever as spam. To ensure
your person-to-person emails reach their destination, Rackspace and the
mail industry recommend some simple guidelines.

The following sections provide our recommended best practices for
sending legitimate person-to-person mail through the Rackspace mail
system. Most reputable mail providers give their own recommendations,
and we encourage you to read those as well.

### Message format

-   Use a reputable and well-known email client to ensure that the email
    you send is correctly constructed and communicated. Features like
    providing HTML and text versions of the message content, correctly
    constructed and formatted email headers, and adherence to
    specifications for sending email (SMTP) are fundamental to sending
    good mail.
-   Make your message's layout as simple as possible. Avoid complex
    formatting, overly elaborate layouts, and multiple images. This
    recommendation is especially important if you use HTML content
    programs like Microsoft Publisher to create your content. These
    programs create complex HTML and styles.
-   If you are sending HTML email, ensure that it's properly constructed.
    Items like missing or empty tags, poor formatting, and non-standard
    conventions are spam indicators.
-   Also, do not use invisible web-based tracking tools in your emails.
-   Don't insert active components (such as JavaScript, ActiveX,
    and plug-ins) in your message. If you need rich media content, link
    to a media-rich page on your website.

### Links

-   Do not use links that contain IP addresses. All reputable sites on
    the Internet use domain names to identify themselves. Using IP
    addresses is a trigger for spam filters.
-   If you link to other companies' sites in your message content,
    ensure that they are reputable sites. If you provide links to
    disreputable sites in your message content, your email will likely
    be marked as spam.
-   Be careful about using shortened URLs in your message content.
    Shortened URLs are often used by spammers to mask the destination of
    the link, and spam filters often flag messages with shortened URLs
    as spam.

### Word choice

-   Pay particular attention to your subject line. Avoid the following
    common spam triggers:
    -   Punctuation (especially exclamation points and question marks)
    -   Capitalization of all letters
    -   Words such as *urgent*, *free*, and *guaranteed*
    -   Spaces between every letter in a word, such as *H e l l o*
-   Use personalized greetings and salutations. For example, use *Hey
    Bob* instead of *Hey* or *To Whom It May Concern*. Generic
    salutations make your content more likely to appear as unsolicited
    mail to spam filters.
-   Don&rsquo;t include a disclaimer that your email isn&rsquo;t spam, and don&rsquo;t
    claim compliance with some legal criteria. Good mail does not need
    to advertise compliance because it *is* compliant.
-   Use normal conversational language. Message content that is rigid or
    follows a consistent limited verbiage can appear like
    computer-generated (or translated) content, which is often flagged
    as spam.
-   Avoid using symbols for letters in words. Spellings like *str@nge* and *g00gle* in your emails often classify the emails
    as spam.
-   Do not overtly reference topics that are highly recognized in spam.
    For example, Rolex watches, Viagra, sexual innuendo, drugs, and
    financial schemes are easily recognizable as topics contained
    in spam. An email that mentions topics typically considered spam
    will most likely cause your email to be considered spam, even if the
    intent of the message is legitimate.

### Attachments

-   It is becoming preferable to avoid attaching files to your messages.
    Most cloud file sites (such as Box.com, Microsoft OneDrive, and
    Google Docs) now offer shareable links to files that you can provide
    in your email. Because attachments are a common way of distributing
    viruses (especially for Windows users), filters are becoming
    increasingly strict about attachments. Blocking zip file attachments
    is a common example of this.
-   If you do send attachments, ensure that they are named correctly and
    that the spelling is correct. Also, chose an attachment name that is
    simple and specific to the nature of the attachment. Oddly named or
    spelled attachments are a common way of transporting viruses.

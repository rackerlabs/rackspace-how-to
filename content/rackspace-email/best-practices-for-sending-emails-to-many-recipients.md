## Overview
The following sections provide our recommended best practices for sending legitimate mail to many recipients through the Rackspace mail system. If you have received a bounce message when sending an email, please reference our list of [Common email bounces](/how-to/common-email-bounces/) for more information.

## Best practices for sending emails to many recipients
Sending email to many recipients is a common practice of spammers. As a result, most email providers have strict rules regarding email content sent to many recipients. It is difficult to distinguish your email from typical mass marketing, newsletter, and other unsolicited mass email content.
To ensure your emails reach their destination, Rackspace and the email industry recommend some simple guidelines.

#### Bulk email
-	Rackspace Cloud Office does not offer bulk email services. To ensure that your emails are not blocked, we recommend that you use a reputable bulk email service to send out your content. Reputable email service providers provide software and services to ensure that your bulk email is delivered in a way that mail providers will accept as good mail. Following are examples of reputable email service providers:

    o	MailChimp and Marketo for marketing, advertising, or promotional emails

    o	MailGun and SendGrid for transactional emails

•	If you use Rackspace Email to send emails to a large number of recipients, respect the Mail Requirements in our Acceptable Use Policy.

#### Recipients
•	Ensure that your recipient lists are current and accurate. Sending emails to a large number of invalid recipients is a clear indicator of spam. Also, mail providers and ISPs can use common invalid addresses as spam traps. Sending mail to these spam traps can result in your domain being blacklisted.
•	Use confirmed opt-in practices when collecting email addresses for mailing lists. Doing so reduces the chances of your messages being considered unsolicited. Unsolicited email is more likely to be marked as spam by recipients, which leads to the sender being flagged as a spammer by content filters.
•	If you send email newsletters or communications to your customers, provide them with a way to remove themselves from your mailing list. Typically you can do this by providing an unsubscribe link in the message or with reply-to instructions. This is required by law.

#### Reputation
•	Maintain a safe and reputable business website. It should include easy access to any privacy policies and contact information for your business. Spam filter providers often audit high-volume senders by visiting your website, which can be a factor in determining whether you are a spammer.
•	Ensure that other companies that you allow to include references to your business are reputable. If they send out spam and your company information is referenced in those emails, your domain could be flagged as being related to spam.

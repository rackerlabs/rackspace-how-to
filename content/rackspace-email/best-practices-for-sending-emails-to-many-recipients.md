Sending email to many recipients is a common practice of spammers. As a
result, most mail providers have strict rules regarding mail content
sent to many recipients. It can be difficult to distinguish your email
from typical mass marketing, newsletter, and other unsolicited mass
email content. To ensure your emails reach their destination, Rackspace
and the mail industry recommend some simple guidelines.

The following sections provide our recommended best practices for
sending legitimate mail to many recipients through the Rackspace mail
system. Most reputable mail providers give their own recommendations,
and we encourage you to read those as well.

### Bulk email

-   Rackspace Email does not provide bulk email services. To ensure that
    your emails are sent safely and are not blocked, we recommend that
    you use a reputable bulk email service to send out your content.
    Reputable email service providers provide software and services to
    ensure that your bulk email is delivered in a way that mail
    providers will accept as good mail. Following are examples of
    reputable email service providers:
    -   MailChimp and Marketo for marketing, advertising, or promotional
        emails
    -   MailGun and SendGrid for transactional emails
-   If you use Rackspace Email to send emails to a large number of
    recipients, respect the Mail Requirements in our [Acceptable Use
    Policy](http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/aup).

### Recipients

-   Ensure that your recipient lists are current and accurate. Sending
    emails to a large number of invalid recipients is a clear indicator
    of spam. Also, mail providers and ISPs can use common invalid
    addresses as spam traps. Sending mail to these spam traps can result
    in your domain being blacklisted.
-   Use confirmed opt-in practices when collecting email addresses for
    mailing lists. Doing so reduces the chances of your messages being
    considered unsolicited. Unsolicited email is more likely to be
    marked as spam by recipients, which leads to the sender being
    flagged as a spammer by content filters.
-   If you send email newsletters or communications to your customers,
    provide them with a way to remove themselves from your mailing list.
    Typically you can do this by providing an unsubscribe link in the
    message or with reply-to instructions. This is required by law.

### Reputation

-   Maintain a safe and reputable business website. It should include
    easy access to any privacy policies and contact information for
    your business. Spam filter providers often audit high-volume senders
    by visiting your website, which can be a factor in determining
    whether you are a spammer.
-   Ensure that other companies that you allow to include references to
    your business are reputable. If they send out spam and your company
    information is referenced in those emails, your domain could be
    flagged as being related to spam.

### Message content

We recommend that you follow our [person-to-person best
practices](/how-to/best-practices-for-sending-person-to-person-email)
when creating the content for your message.

Rackspace strives to maintain the best possible reputation with other
mail providers and the email industry. Our Anti-Abuse and Acceptable Use
teams work diligently to protect our users from abusive email. An
important part of helping us maintain our reputation is helping you send
good email.

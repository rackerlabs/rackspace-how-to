Webmail private label sites created before September 2017 were deployed to an environment that did not enforce the use of secure web protocols over https, such as SSL or TLS. In order to add this additional level of protection to your existing Webmail private label site, we recommend you secure it.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrators of Reseller Accounts
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 5 minutes to secure the site, 24-48 hours for the DNS changes to propagate
- **Tools required:**  DNS host administrator access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Secure Webmail Private Label Site

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com), and perform the following steps:

2. In the **Reseller Tools** section of the home page, click the **Webmail Sites** link.

3. On the **Webmail Sites** page, locate the site that you want to secure. It should have a red "unlocked" icon to the right of the name.

4. Click the 'Secure Site' action from the **Actions** drop-down.

5. On the **Secure Webmail Site*** page, enter or verify the company information for your site. This information is used to register the security certificate that will secure your site. This information is visible by your end users, if they choose to view the certificate from their browser. Click 'Secure Site'.

6. You will be presented with instructions to update the DNS entry for your site with new information. Copy these instructions by clicking **Copy Instructions** before clicking **Ok, Got It**.

      - The DNS for most existing sites will be an A record that points to a specific IP address. You need to change the A record type to CNAME, and change the IP address to the hostname provided. For example, if your webmail site is going to be **mail.yourdomainexample.com**, you would change the hostname to **mail** or **mail.yourdomainexample.com**. The tables below illustrate this change.

      **Before DNS change:**

      |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
      |---|---|---|
      |A| @ | 000.00.000.00 |

      **After DNS change:**

      |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
      |---|---|---|
      |CNAME| mail| pl-10.webmail.emailsrvr.com |

      - If your existing DNS record is already a CNAME, then just update the existing hostname to the new one provided.

      **Example DNS entry:**

      |Record Type | Host | Point-to/Address |
      |---|---|---|
      |CNAME| mail| pl-10.webmail.emailsrvr.com |

    Note: For specific instructions on editing your DNS records, please contact your DNS host. [Find your DNS host here.](/how-to/find-dns-host)

Once the DNS change is propagated, the site will show as secured in the **Webmail Sites** listing. It will have a green "locked" icon to the right of the name.

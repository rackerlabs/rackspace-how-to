- **Tools Needed:** Administrators need access to their Cloud Office Control Panel, Rackspace Email users need access to apps.rackspace.com

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

With the methods available to compromise an account growing in both number and sophistication, properly managing password security is more important
than ever to ensure that your business is not compromised.


#### Control Panel Password Management

Access to the control panel is the key to the kingdom. Every precaution should be taken to prevent unwanted guests from accessing this powerful tool.

- Always set up Two-Factor Authentication
- Consider setting restrictions such as for admin access such as [**Login restricted to IP addresses**](/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel/) or disabling [**Allow simultaneous logins using this Administrative ID**](/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel/).


### Creating an Effective Password

Meeting password requirements does not create a password robust enough to stop someone determined to access your account. A strong password is does not fit a pattern. While password requirements help prevent the most egregious of weak passwords, they do not make a password unpredictable which is what we want from a strong password.

Consider the following when crafting a new password:

    - Do some research. Is the password you are considering on a list of *Top 25 Most Common Passwords*? If so, you need to start from scratch and craft a new password.

    - Have you used this password before? If so it is time to move on to something new.

    - Do you use this password for other websites or logins? This is never a good idea. If one account is compromised, they are all compromised.

    - Are you repeating patterns in your password? *fourfour44!!* may satisfy a password requirement but it is easily predicted by a program trying to access your most valuable information.

    - Are there patterns in your password construction? An example would be a password containing a capital letter at the beginning of the password, a symbol at the end and a number in the last two characters.

    - Do not use personal information or common words or phrases in your password.
        - Do not include your birthday
        - Do not include a family member's birthday
        - Do not include your initials

    - Create a memorable password by creating a very unique password!
        - Example: on3DayWeW!llAllHavEhoV3rCars

It is no longer a question of if a password can be cracked, but how long it will take to crack it. Many password can be cracked in minutes or hours, but a great password will take decades or a millennia for a program to crack.

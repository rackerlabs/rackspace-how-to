With the methods available to compromise an account growing in both number and sophistication, properly managing password security is more important
than ever to ensure that your business is not compromised.


### Common password attack types

**Phishing** - Phishing is the act of impersonating a legitimate entity to obtain sensitive information from users such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and the like. In email, phishing scams commonly utilize a method of email impersonation called [spoofing](/how-to/). A successful phishing attach is particularly damaging because you have volunteered your current credentials to the scammer and they now have access.

    - Never use the same password for different sites and accounts. Employing this policy helps contain the damage if you are phished.
    - Immediately change your password if you suspect you have fallen victim to a phishing attack.
    - Alert your company of the attack.

**Malware** - Malicious software that collects information from you without your knowledge. Passwords are captured through keystroke logging.

    - Always make sure that you regularly update things like your operating systems, internet browser, and any other software you regularly use.
    - Be cautious of any email that includes a link or attachment, regardless of who it appears to be sent from.
    - Install an antivirus program.

**Hammering** - Hackers will try a list of common passwords against a list of usernames in hopes that a user will match a common password.  

    - Create a stronger password. Is the password you are considering on a list of *Top 25 Most Common Passwords*? Is the password similar in any way? If so, you are a prime target for this attack and should strengthen your password.

**Proof compromise** Password reset protocols are typically based off of alternate contact information like phone numbers or email address. If a hacker has the information to reset your password, they have no need for you current password.

    - Always keep any contact information current so that outdated information cannot be used to reset your password.




### Password best practices

Meeting password requirements does not create a password robust enough to stop someone determined to access your account. While password requirements help prevent the most egregious of weak passwords, they do not make a password unbreakable.

1. User education. A compromise that starts with one user will quickly spread to many. Ensure that your users are taking precautions and know

Consider the following when crafting a new password:

  - Do some research. Is the password you are considering on a list of *Top 25 Most Common Passwords*? If so, you need to start from scratch and craft a new password.
  - Have you used this password before? If so it is time to move on to something new.
  - Do you use this password for other websites or logins? This is never a good idea. If one account is compromised, they are all compromised.
  - Are you repeating patterns in your password? *fourfour44!!* may satisfy a password requirement but it is easily predicted by a program trying to access your most valuable information.
  - Are there patterns in your password construction? An example would be a password containing a capital letter at the beginning of the password, a symbol at the end and a number in the last two characters.
  - Do not use personal information or common words or phrases in your password.

        - Do not include your birthday
        - Do not include a family member's birthday
        - Do not include your initials

  - Create a memorable password by creating a very unique password!

        - Example: on3DayWew!llAllH4vEhoV3r:Cars

It is no longer a question of if a password can be cracked, but how long it will take to crack it. Many password can be cracked in minutes or hours, but a great password will take decades or a millennia for a program to crack.

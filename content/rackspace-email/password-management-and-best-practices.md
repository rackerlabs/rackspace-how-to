With the methods available to compromise an account growing in both number and sophistication, properly managing password security is more important than ever to ensure that your business is not compromised. This article examines common password attack types and password best practices to combat them.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator and User

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).


### Common password attack types

The following methods are the most common used by attackers to attempt to compromise your accounts:

#### Phishing 

Phishing is the act of impersonating a legitimate entity to obtain sensitive information from users such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and so on. In email, phishing scams commonly utilize a method of email impersonation called [spoofing](/how-to/email-spoofing-explained). A successful phishing attack is particularly damaging because you have volunteered your current credentials to the scammer and they now have access.

Use the following guidelines to protect your passwords from phishing attempts:

- Never provide sensitive information without verifying that the request originates from a legitimate entity.

- Never use the same password for different sites and accounts. Employing this policy helps contain the damage if you are phished.

- Immediately change your password if you suspect you have fallen victim to a phishing attack.

- Notify company employees to remain vigilant and remind them of verification practices.

#### Malware

Malicious software that collects information from you without your knowledge is called
malware. Passwords are captured through keystroke logging.

Use the following guidelines to avoid exposing your systems to malware:

- Always make sure that you regularly install security updates for your operating systems, internet browsers, and any other software you regularly use.

- Be cautious of any email that includes a link or attachment, regardless of who it appears to be sent from.

- Install an antivirus program.

#### Dictionary Attack 

Hackers try a list of passwords against a username in hopes that the user has used an easy-to-guess password.

To prevent hackers from guessing your passwords create a unique password. Using a common password makes you a prime target for this attack and you should strengthen your password. See [Password best practices](#password-best-practices) for guidance.

#### Password Reset Protocol Attack 

Password reset protocols are typically based on alternate contact information like phone numbers or email address. If a hacker has the information to reset your password, they have no need for your current password.

Use the following guideline to prevent hackers from guessing your passwords:

- Always keep contact information current so that outdated information cannot be used to impersonate you.

- When you set up security questions and answers, select a question that cannot be learned by an attacker researching your online social media accounts. For example, "What University did I graduate from?" is a bad security question. An attacker can likely find this information on your public Facebook or LinkedIn profile.

### Password best practices

Meeting password requirements does not create a password robust enough to stop someone determined to access your account. While password requirements help prevent the most egregious of weak passwords, they do not make a password unbreakable.

Use the following guidelines to protect your accounts and create strong passwords:

1. **User education**. 

    A compromise typically starts with one user, and quickly spreads through a whole company. Ensure that your users are taking precautions and know password best practices.

2. **Avoid patterns**. 
    
    Patterns are the key to a hackers success. People are very predictable and as such, make predictable passwords.

      - Do you repeat words or characters in your password to meet the character length requirement? **fourfour44!!**  or **PasswordPassword** may satisfy a password length requirement but it is easily predicted by a program trying to access your most valuable information.

      - Are you reusing passwords for multiple sites, application or accounts? If your social media account is compromised, a hackers is going to try to access any other accounts you have elsewhere. Reusing passwords ensures that they will succeed.

      - Is your password construction similar every time you change it?
        
           - Examine the password example **Predictable2017**.  The first letter is capitalized and the password ends in a number. Many people construct their passwords this way which is why a malicious hacking program will always check for it.
           - You may think you can throw off the hacker with some character substitutions like **Pr3dictab132017**. This is also a predictable pattern that many people use in passwords.

      - Changing aspects of your password is not really changing your password. It is only a good idea to implement a password change schedule if you truly create a new unique password each time.

3. **Password strength**.  

    Character requirements and password length are only useful if you avoid patterns and are vigilant against attacks like **phishing**, **malware**, **proof attacks** and so on.
    
    Use the following guidelines to create a strong password:

      - Avoiding patterns is your primary goal when you create a password. The more unique you can make the password, the better.

      - Do not include public or personal information about yourself or those close to you in the password, including:

         - Birthdays.
         - Pet names.
         - Anniversaries.
         - Company names, founding dates, addresses, and so on.

      - Try using a memorable phrase. For example: **oneDayWew!llAllH4vEhoV6r:Cars**. In this example, instead of substituting letters for similar looking numbers, substitute random numbers. Instead of capitalizing the first character, leave it lower case. Instead of ending the password with a number, end with a word.

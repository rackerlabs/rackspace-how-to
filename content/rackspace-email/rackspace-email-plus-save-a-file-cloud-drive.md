### Saving documents to Cloud Drive

Ensure that Cloud Drive is installed on your device before continuing. If you have not yet installed Cloud Drive follow the instructions for [Installing Cloud Drive](/how-to/rackspace-email-plus-getting-started/#cloud-drive-for-desktop).

Once you have installed Cloud Drive, follow these instructions to save a file in your Cloud Drive.

1. Open file explorer for Windows. You can do this by clicking the Windows start menu in the lower-left hand corner of your screen and selecting the file explorer application.

#### What types of environments can you migrate from?

We support migrations from Exchange Server 2003, 2007, and 2010 (in-house and hosted), Google Apps, Gmail, GroupWise 7 and 8, Zimbra, Lotus Notes, POP, and IMAP. See [Email migration services](/how-to/email-migration-services) for a list of migration options.

#### How much does a migration to Rackspace cost?

Both self-service migration and Assisted Migration are free of charge.

#### How long does it take to migrate my servers to Rackspace?

Migration times vary per customer. Some migrate in hours and others migrate in days or weeks. The migration process is a partnership between you and the migration team. Consider your availability and resources when planning your migration as they will be needed for the testing phase of the migration and will impact the overall timeline of the transition.

#### Is the migration manual or is it automated?

We use a combination of automated tools and experienced Rackers to perform the migration. At each step of the migration, we stay in close contact with your team to help you get a successful outcome.  See [Email migration services](/how-to/email-migration-services) for a list of migration options.

#### What server information do you need for the migration?

After you submit your migration request, our email migration experts will discuss available approaches with you, depending on the configuration of your source server and your migration type. Our team will require that you provide the source server address/URL and all usernames and passwords for the mailboxes. A spreadsheet will be sent to you for this step in the process.

#### Can my users access their mail and other data during the migration?

Yes, users can continue to access and use their mailbox normally. However, we strongly recommend that passwords not be reset during the migration.

#### What types of email data will be migrated?

See [Items migrated during a Cloud Office migration](/how-to/items-migrated-during-an-cloud-office-migration).

#### Can I upgrade from Rackspace Email or Microsoft Exchange to Office 365 with Rackspace?

Yes you can! Reference [Rackspace Email and Microsoft Exchange upgrade to Office 365 FAQ](/how-to/rackspace-email-and-microsoft-exchange-upgrade-to-office-365-faq/) for options and instructions.

#### Can I change from Rackspace Email to Exchange or from Exchange to Rackspace Email?

Yes, this process is referred to as a *platform change*, which our Internal Migration team will perform for you at no cost. You can place a request by contacting our support team through chat or a support ticket, both available through the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

#### Does the Migration Tool create mailboxes on my account or will I need to create the mailboxes first?

The tool will not create the mailboxes. They will need to be created in the control panel prior to the migration. It will only migrate data to existing mailboxes on your account.

#### We have slow bandwidth and a slow in-house server. Will your migration tool work?

Yes. We have highly experienced Rackers who have helped customers migrate from a variety of environments. If the migration speed does not meet your expectations, we can also migrate via **.pst** files using FTP for Exchange mailboxes.

#### What if my question was not answered in this FAQ?

Our Support Team who is available 24x7x365 will be happy to answer any specific questions you may have.

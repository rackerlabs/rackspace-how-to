This article describes how to set up your email signature, which can include your title, phone number, or any other content you want to display.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Users
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** 5 minutes
- **Tools required:** Webmail access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

When creating your signature you should be cautious about what is included. Signatures now more frequently contain elements that are viewed as spam by common email filters, which can hinder email deliverability. See [Best practices for sending person-to-person email](/how-to/best-practices-for-sending-person-to-person-email) for guidance on signature creation.

1. Log in to your Rackspace Email account by going to [apps.rackspace.com](http://apps.rackspace.com).

2. Click the **Support** menu in the upper-right corner of the page, and then click **Settings**.

3. In the left pane, click **Composing Email** and then click the **Signatures** tab.

4. Click **Add New Signature**.

5. In the **Add New Signature** dialog box, enter a descriptive name for your signature. In the **Edit Signature** area, enter the text for your signature. You can use plain text, HTML, or rich text with the formatting options available in the editor (for example, bold, italics, and colored text).

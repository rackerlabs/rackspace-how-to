## Verify email delivery


## Overview
Emails do not deliver for a variety of reasons. If you are not sure if an email reached it’s  intended recipient or an email sent to you is missing, there are steps you can take to narrow down what may have happened to the message.




#### Incoming message delivery
If you expected to receive a message that never arrived, try the following steps:
-	Perform a search on your mailbox. Using your mailbox’s search function will discover a message that was hiding in a sub-folder.
-	Does your mailbox have any rules or filters applied?
-	Check your Spam/Junk/Trash folders.
-	Check your recover deleted items folder	.

    Log into apps.rackspace.com > Place your cursor over “Trash” or “Deleted Items” > right-click and select “Recover Deleted Items” from the menu. A box will pop up displaying messages in your recover deleted items folder.
    
- Allow ample time to ensure there is not a message delay
-	Did the recipient receive a bounce message? If so, reference (link to bounces) for possible solutions.
-	Did the recipient send to an Alias, Contact, Group List, or Distribution List? If so these addresses will not forward any message flagged as spam.

#### Outgoing message delivery
-	Did you receive a bounce message? If so, reference (link to bounces) for possible solutions.
-	If you are sending from a desktop such as Outlook, is the message in Drafts or the Outbox?
-	Log into apps.rackspace.com and attempt sending the message again.
-	Try sending the message from a computer connected to a different internet network.
-	Verify with the recipient that your message was not stored in a sub-folder.
-	Verify with the recipient that your message was not marked as spam. If your message was marked as spam please reference (link to best pract) to prevent this in the future.

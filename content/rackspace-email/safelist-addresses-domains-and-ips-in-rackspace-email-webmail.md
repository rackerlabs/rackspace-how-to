### What does Safelisting accomplish?

In short, **Safelisting** an address creates a rule that moves any message flagged as spam from the address you **Safelisted** to the **Inbox** so that you do not miss the message. If you need to **Blacklist** a sender, see [Blacklist addresses, domains and IPs in Rackspace Email webmail](/how-to/blacklist-addresses-domains-and-ips-in-rackspace-email-webmail).

**Warning:** Safelisting DOES NOT prevent a sender from being flagged as spam or from being blocked.

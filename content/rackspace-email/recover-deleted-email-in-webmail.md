For up to 14 days, users can recover email messages even after the messages have been purged from the Trash folder. To do so, log in to [Webmail](https://apps.rackspace.com), and perform the following steps:

1. Right-click the **Trash** folder and select **Recover Deleted Email**.

2. Select the messages that you want to recover.

3. Click **Recover to Folder** and select the folder you want to move the messages to.

When you see the confirmation `Message(s) Recovered`, you are done.

**Note:** Admins can perform this task on behalf of their users by using the **Log In As**
functionality available in the Cloud Office Control Panel.

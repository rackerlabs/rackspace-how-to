When you create a company directory, users in the directory have access
to up-to-date contact information for all users in the directory. Users
can access the company directory information through Webmail, via the
Contacts tab.

To view a company directory list, log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com) and perform
the following steps:

1.  From the **Go to section** menu, select **Rackspace Email**.

2.  In the **Collaboration** section, click **Company Directory**.

From here, you can add, edit, or delete an alias. See the following instructions below specific to the action you would like to take.

### Add or edit a company directory

1.  While viewing the **Company Directory** list, click on the name of
    the directory you want to edit. If you are creating a new directory, click
    **Add Directory**.

2.  Enter or change the following information as needed.

    -   Use the **Name** box to change or create the directory's name.

    -   To allow users to edit their personal contact information, select
        the **Allow users to edit their profile** check box.

    -   In the **Domains** section, select a domain that you want to
        add to the directory, and then click **Add**. Use
        the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate a domain.

        **Note:** You can add several domains to the same directory, but
        each domain can belong to only one directory.

    -   To make changes to members, click the **Add/Remove
        Members** tab. Use the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate
        the mailboxes you want to include, and then click **Add**.

    -   To add mailboxes that are outside your domain, type their email
        addresses in the **Add Members outside this Domain** box and
        click **Add**. Then, click on the newly listed email address and
        click on **Edit Contact Info**. Enter additional information as
        needed in the new window, and then click **Ok**.

3.  Click **Save**.

### Delete a company directory

1.  Select the check box next to each directory that you want to delete. Or,
    to select all directories, select the check box that appears next to
    **Delete**.

2.  Click **Delete**.

3.  A pop-up box will appear to confirm that you want to delete
    the directory. Click **Delete *n* company directory**.

Learn how to manage blacklist settings for your domain. Blacklists can
be set up by email address, domain, or IP address.

To modify the domains or IP addresses on your domain blacklist, [log
in to the Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com) and perform the
following steps:

1.  From the **Go to section** menu, select **Domains**.
2.  In the **Spam Filtering** section, click **Blacklists**.
3.  If you have multiple domains, you may be prompted to select a
    domain name. Or, to change domains at any time, click the **change
    domain** link.
4.  To add a domain name or email address to the blacklist, enter it in
    the **Enter a domain or email address** box, and then click
    **Add**. If you have multiple domains or email addresses
    to block, use the bulk import option to upload a **.csv** or **.txt** file
    containing the information.
6.  To remove a domain or email address, click the name in the list, and
    then click **Remove**. To remove all domains or email addresses listed in the window, click **Clear**.
7.  To add an IP address to the blacklist, enter it in the **Enter an IP
    address (or range)** box, and then click **Add**. If
    you have multiple IP addresses to block, use the bulk import option
    to upload a **.csv** or **.txt** file containing the information.
8.  To remove an IP address, click the address in the list, and then
    click **Remove**. To remove all IP addresses listed in the window, click **Clear**.
9.  Click **Save**.

We offer a number of email migration services to our customers at no
charge. Our team of email migration experts are here to help you in case
you have any questions or concerns.

### External migration services

If you are a new customer and require email data to be migrated from another provider, we can help. We've partnered with a third-party company called MigrationWiz to provide two migration
support options to make your transition as easy as possible.

#### Option 1: Self-service migration

Run your migration at any time of the day or night with MigrationWiz, which is available from the Cloud Office Control Panel. [Click here to begin](https://cp.rackspace.com/Domains/Tools/Migrations).

The benefits of using the self-service tool are as follows:

-   Migrate from any provider to Hosted Exchange or Rackspace Email
-   Includes a no-cost trial migration
-   Migrates contacts, calendars, tasks, and notes data when moving from
    Exchange to Exchange

    button

#### Option 2: Assisted migration

Assisted migrations are ideal for companies that need help consulting,
planning, and scheduling a migration project. Our assisted migration
service will provide you with peace of mind knowing that your migration
is being coordinated by the best team of email migration experts. [Click
here to request an assisted
migration](https://cp.rackspace.com/Domains/Tools/Migrations/Assisted).

The benefits of choosing an assisted migration are as follows:

-   A migration specialist dedicated to your project
-   A custom migration plan based on consultation with your specialist
-   A scheduled time slot with your specialist to perform your migration
-   Timely updates from your specialist throughout the process
-   Documentation and recommendations on managing the migration for your
    end-users

Assisted Migrations are a partnership between your company and our
team of experts. Throughout the process we will require some action and
information from you.

Migrations vary based on the type of mailboxes we are migrating to and
from. See the following chart for a list of what will migrate using
our services.

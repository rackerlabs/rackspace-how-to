### Why use a safelist?

**Safelisting** an address creates a rule that moves any message flagged as spam from the address you safelisted to the **Inbox** so that you do not miss the message. If you need to **blacklist** a sender, see [Blacklist addresses, domains and IP addresses in Rackspace Email](/how-to/blacklist-addresses-domains-and-ip-addresses-in-rackspace-email).

**Warning:** Safelisting does not prevent a sender from being flagged as spam or from being blocked.

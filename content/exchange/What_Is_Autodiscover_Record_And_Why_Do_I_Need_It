# What is Autodiscover?
In order for Exchange account to function properly in Outlook, you must have a special DNS record set up for your domain name which points to Rackspace Cloud Office's Autodiscover server.

# What Features Does Autodiscover Provide?
You need to set up the Autodiscover record for your domain name to have the following Exchange features:
1. Setup Outlook 2007/2010/2013/2016 for Windows setup using Autodiscovery.
2. Setup Outlook 2011/2016 for Mac using Autodiscovery.
3. Free/Busy information for Calendar Scheduling
4. Out of Office setup and management through Outlook.
**Note**: Without the Autodiscover record you can use Outlook Web Access to set up automatic replies. 
5. Offline Address Book synchronization.
6. Sharing Calendars, Contacts, and Folders using Sharing invitation within Outlook.
7. Access to Public Folders in Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2016.
8. Automapping of Shared Mailboxes

# How Do I Setup Autodiscover?

#How do I Check if Autodiscover is Resolving Correctly to Rackspace?

To determine if the Autodiscover service is configured properly, you may use the **Test E-mail AutoConfiguration tool** in Outlook.

1. While Outlook is running, hold down the CTRL key, right-click the Outlook icon in your system tray or notification area (lower right corner of computer screen). Select **Test E-mail AutoConfiguration**.

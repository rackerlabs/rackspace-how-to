When you create a distribution list in Hosted Microsoft Exchange,
you are creating a group email address.
When someone sends an email to that email address,
the email is automatically sent to all the members of the distribution list.
These members can be mailboxes within the domain,
contacts outside of the domain, or both.

### View all distribution lists

To view all distribution lists, log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/) and perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Go to section** menu and select **Microsoft Exchange**.

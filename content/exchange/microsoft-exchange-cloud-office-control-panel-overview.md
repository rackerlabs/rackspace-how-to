After you sign up for Cloud Office services through Rackspace, the first thing
to do is log in to the Cloud Office Control Panel. This article
provides a brief overview of the features that you have access to in the control panel. New Cloud Office customers can access the control panel [here](https://cp.rackspace.com/) and UK and MyRackspace customers can log in [here](https://my.rackspace.com/).

After you log in to the control panel, you will see a variety of
sections that showcase the services for which you have signed up. Each section has a variety of
options and tools to choose from. As you sign up for additional services, they will appear here to enable you to manage them directly from the landing page.

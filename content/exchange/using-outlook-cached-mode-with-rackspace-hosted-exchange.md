Outlook 2010 and 2013 have a feature called Cached Exchange Mode that keeps a copy of your email on your computer. The copy is faster for Outlook to load and search, and you can access it when your computer is not connected to the Internet.

Outlook 2013 for Windows lets you choose how much email to keep in the cache. By default, it stores email for up to twelve months on your machine. To adjust the amount of email saved, adjust the **Mail to keep offline** slider in Outlook settings:

1.  Click **File** > **Account Settings** > **Account Settings**
2.  In the Account Settings window, double-click your **Microsoft Exchange account** on the E-mail tab
3.  In the Change Account window, drag the **Mail to keep offline** slider to the desired number of months
4. Click **Next** and then **Finish**

For more information, see the Microsoft Support article [Only a subset of your Exchange mailbox items are synchronized in Outlook 2013](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2733062).

Some users use Cached Mode as an extra backup. While it's a good idea to keep multiple copies of vital information, Cached Exchange Mode doesn't really suit that need. Rackspace already makes multiple copies of all your email data, and our Email Archiving service gives you unlimited forever storage of all email sent and received for $3 per user.

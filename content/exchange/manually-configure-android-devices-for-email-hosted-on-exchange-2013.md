This article helps [email
hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/email-hosting/webmail) users to manually
configure Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg; 2013 on most Android&trade; devices.

**Note:** For personalized user and server information and device-specific
instructions, use the [Email Help Tool](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/).

address.

   devices), as shown in the following image:

    <img src="{% asset_path exchange/manually-configure-android-devices-for-email-hosted-on-exchange-2013/4.%20Exchange%20ActiveSync_2.png %}" width="217" height="386" />

   shown in the following image:

6. On the next page, enter information in the following fields, then tap
   **Next**:

   - **Email address**: Your email address (for example, **test@emailcompany.org**).
   - **Server address**: **mex06.emailsrvr.com** or **mex08.emailsrvr.com**.

     **Note:** Use the [Email Help Tool](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com/) to get the correct server address for your device.

   - **Domain**: Leave this field blank.
   - **Username**: Enter your email address again.

      **Note**: Some devices might combine the domain and username
      settings as domain\username. On those devices, precede your email
      address with a backslash (for example, **\test@emailcompany.org**).

   - **Password**: The password associated with your email address.
   - **This server requires an encrypted SSL connection**: Select this option.

7. If you're prompted to enable remote security administration, tap **OK** or
   **Allow**.

    If the device is lost or stolen, this setting enables you to remotely
    perform a factory reset (delete all data) on the device from the Outlook
    Web App (OWA).

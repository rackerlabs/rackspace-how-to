### Safelist Senders

Safelisting does not prevent a sender from being flagged as spam. Safelisting ensures that a sender's message is delivered to your inbox, even if the sender is flagged as spam, so that messages from a trusted source aren't overlooked in the junk folder. 

For administrator instructions on safelisting senders through the control panel, see [Blacklists in Microsoft Exchange](/how-to/spam-preferences-safe-lists-and-black-list-in-microsoft-exchange/#managing-safe-list).

1. Log in to your Exchange mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](apps.rackspace.com).

2. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner, and then select **Options** from the drop down menu.

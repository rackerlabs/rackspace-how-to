#### Safelist Senders

Safelisting does not prevent a sender from being flagged as spam. Safelisting ensures that sender's message will be placed in your Inbox in the event they are flagged as spam. This feature is used to prevent a message from a trusted source from  being overlooked in the Junk folder. Administrators can reference [Blacklists in Microsoft Exchange](/how-to/spam-preferences-safe-lists-and-black-list-in-microsoft-exchange/#managing-safe-list) for instructions on rejecting senders.

1. Log into your Exchange mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](apps.rackspace.com)

2. Click the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner. Select **Options** from the drop down menu.

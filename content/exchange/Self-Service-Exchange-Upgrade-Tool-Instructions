   # Self Service Exchange Upgrade Tool Instructions

# Helpful Information:

- There is no cost for this migration through this tool
- You can run an Exchange upgrade through this tool 24/7/365. Support is available during that time to assist, but should your migration error out and need the assistance of the Internal Migration Team, be advised that team is only in office M-F from 7am to 7pm CST.
- WHAT IS MIGRATED: Current Exchange environment which includes:
  - Exchange Mailboxes
  - Email data
  - Contacts
  - Calendar
  - Tasks
  - Notes
  - Exchange Contacts
  - Distribution Lists
  - Resources

## Exchange Upgrade Tool Requirements:

In order to utilize this tool, you **MUST** have the following items:

- Make sure your Autodiscover record is set up and points to Rackspace. To Setup Autodiscover: [http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge\_center/article/how-to-set-up-dns-records-for-email-and-skype-for-business](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-to-set-up-dns-records-for-email-and-skype-for-business)
- Less than 25 Public Folders currently with your Exchange 2007 services (more details listed below)

# Prior to your Migration:

### Here are the supported email clients for Exchange 2016:

Anything older clients will not be able to successfully connect to our Exchange 2016 environment.

- Outlook 2016
- Outlook 2013
- Outlook 2011 for Mac
- Outlook 2010
- Outlook 2007 SP3
- Entourage 2008 EWS
- Mac Mail

### Here are some other things to consider prior to utilizing this tool:

- This type of migration requires all users to migrate at once.
- We highly recommend performing a local backup of your data since corrupt items will not migrate.
- The spam handling in Exchange 2016 **DOES NOT** utilize the quarantine manager for exchange mailboxes. Messages marked as spam will be delivered to the **JUNK-EMAIL** folder of the user&#39;s mailbox. The domain quarantine will still receive spam messages for other exchange addresses such as contacts, distribution lists and resources.
- Custom permissions for distribution lists (such as Send As/Restricted) and custom permissions for shared calendars in your email clients are **NOT** migrated.

# Running the Migration

## During the Migration:

- **DO NOT** make changes to the domain within the admin control panel because it will negatively impact the migration.
- This migration is a &quot;live mailbox move&quot;, which means that users can send and receive mail as the migration is taking place.

## Step 1:

Log in at [Rackspacemigrations.com](https://rackspacemigrations.com/Account/Login) with the following information:

- Account number
- Admin ID
- Password

You will be taken to a portal that lists all of your domains with Exchange services. Select the gear icon next to the domain you would like to upgrade (see below):

## Step 2:

You will be prompted to select a date and time (time zone is Central Standard Time). You can only schedule migrations every hour, on the hour.

## Step 3:

After selecting the date and time you will be taken to a screen that will seek your confirmation. Click &quot;Submit Migration&quot; when ready.

You will then be taken back to the main screen. You will see the status for your migration as well as the Support Ticket number created to track your migration. Unless you log into your mail control panel and update this ticket, no automatic responses will be emailed directly to you.

As you can see from the screen shot, you have the ability to Reschedule or Cancel your migration prior to it starting.

\*\*Some things that affect the length of the migration are:

- Item count
- Mailbox size
- Total size of attachments
- Number of mailboxes on the domain
- Provisioning delays in our Exchange environment (you can consult our Rackspace Status Page, http://status.apps.rackspace.com/) for notice on this type of issue.

## Step 4:

Once the migration begins you can monitor the status in the home page of rackspacemigrations.com. When the migration completes you can log into your Mail Control Panel and manage the mailboxes.

# Post Migration:

- Users will have immediate access to the new Outlook Web Access: apps.rackspace.com
- If the existing Outlook profile was created using Autodiscover (autodiscover.emailsrvr.com), the user should receive a prompt to allow changes to be made. If the changes do not take place, a new profile will be needed.
- All mobile devices will need to be reconfigured. (Blackberry devices configured as BES must be wiped in order to successfully reactivate on the newer Exchange services)

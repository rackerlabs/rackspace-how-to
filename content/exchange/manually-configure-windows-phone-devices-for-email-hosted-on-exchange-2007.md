ActiveSync devices are unique, based on device and provider. You will
need the information provided in the User Control Panel to set up
Exchange on an ActiveSync device.

1. Log into your [User Control Panel](https://admin.emailsrvr.com/usercp).

2. In the **Client Setup** section, click the **ActiveSync** link.
   This opens the **Setting Up ActiveSync** window.
   You will need the information displayed in the **Setting Up ActiveSync**
   window to set up the account.

3. Locate the **Settings** options from within your
   application menu.

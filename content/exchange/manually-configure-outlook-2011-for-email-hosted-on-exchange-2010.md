4. Click **Add Account** and confirm that the amber-colored dot
   next to the account name turns from an amber color to a solid green color
   (this may take a moment).

   Close all windows and you're done!

**Note:** The amber dot may take a minute or two to change from amber to
green. If it doesn't change, check the accounts settings and password and make
sure you are using the correct EWS server address.

**Note:** If you already
have email on the server, your email will slowly begin to populate your
inbox. This can take some time depending on how much data you have.

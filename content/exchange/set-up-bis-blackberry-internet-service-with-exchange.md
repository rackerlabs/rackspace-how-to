This article describes the setup process for users who have an Exchange mailbox
but do not have a
BlackBerry Enterprise Service (BES) license and
want to use Blackberry Internet Service (BIS) instead.

A BES license allows maximum
Exchange functionality on the BlackBerry, including contacts and
calendar. Setting up a BES license is done by an administrator,
as described at [Add an ActiveSync or BES license](/how-to/email-migration-services).

**Note:** Support for email accounts and email setup may vary by service
provider.

To associate your BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) account with Outlook
Web Access (OWA), perform the following steps:

1. Log into your User Control Panel at <https://admin.emailsrvr.com/usercp>.

2. Under the Client Setup section, click the **Entourage 2008**
link. This will open the **Setting Up Entourage 2008** window. Though
BIS is not based on Entourage, the addresses and the user name are the
same. You will need this information to set up the account.

3. Log into the BIS website for your carrier.

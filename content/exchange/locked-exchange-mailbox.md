Warning: You must gather all devices that may make connections to the locked mailbox to successfully resolve the issue.

### How to tell if your mailbox is locked

- Have you recently changed the password to the mailbox?

- Are you repeatedly being prompted for a password on any of your devices?

- Have you attempted to log into apps.rackspace.com without success?

Answering yes to any of the above questions could mean that your Exchange mailbox is locked. It could also be time to update your password if you are having trouble remembering it.


### What to do if your mailbox is Locked

  1. Gather all of the devices you use to check email.

    Note: Having every device is crucially important to stopping the cycle of lockouts.

  2. Remove the cached password from each device. This may require locating instructions for specific devices. Most manufactures will have instructions for completing this process.

  3. Allow at least 30 minutes to pass. Once 30 minutes have passed, try logging into apps.rackspace.com.

   Note: Your account Administrator can unlock the mailbox immediately.

  4. Once you have successfully logged in at apps.rackspace.com, begin connecting to email on each of your devices, imputing your password as you are prompted for it on each device.

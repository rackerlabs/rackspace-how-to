The following article explains how to create a contact with
Microsoft Exchange. You can use a contact to create an alias that
forwards to a mailbox hosted outside of your domain, such as at Gmail or Yahoo.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).

2. In the **Microsoft Exchange** section, select **Contacts**.

3. In the contacts window, select **Add Contact**.

   **Note:** If you have multiple domains you may be prompted to select a
   domain name.

4. Enter the following **User Details**:

   - First name
   - Last name
   - Display name - the name that is displayed in the Global Address Book.
   - User name
   - External email - the email address that the email will route to.

   If you do not want this contact to be visible in the Global Address Book, Check the **Hide from Global Address List** check box.

5. Click **Save**.

Microsoft Exchange. You can use a contact to create an alias that
forwards to a mailbox hosted outside of your domain, such as at Gmail or Yahoo.

   **Note:** If you have multiple domains you may be prompted to select a
   domain name.

3. Enter the name of the contact, the display name that will be
   displayed in the Global Address Book, an email address, and the external
   email address that the email will route to. Then select **Save**.

If you do not want this contact to be visible in the Global Address Book,
Check the **Hide from Global Address List** check box.

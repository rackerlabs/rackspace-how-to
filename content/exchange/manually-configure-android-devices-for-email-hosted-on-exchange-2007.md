The following steps are required to configure Microsoft Exchange 2007 on
most Android devices:

**Note:** Before you can begin, your administrator must
[Add an ActiveSync license](/how-to/add-an-activesync-or-bes-license)
and assign it to your email address.

1. Log into your **User
   Control Panel** at the following
   URL: [https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp).

2. Scroll down to the **Client Setup** section
   and click on the **ActiveSync** link. This will open the **Setting Up
   ActiveSync** window which will contain the information needed to set up
   your device.

3. With your **Setting Up ActiveSync** window open, select
   the **Settings** icon from the **Home** screen on your device.

4. Next, select **Accounts and Sync** and then select **Microsoft
   Exchange ActiveSync**.

5. Next, enter your email address and password under the **Configure
   exchange account in a few steps** field. Then select the **Manual
   setup** option.

   **Note:** Depending on what OS version of Android you're running, if you have
   only "Domain" as an option, you may leave this field blank.

6. Next, enter the domain address exactly as it appears in
   the **Setting Up ActiveSync** window followed by a "\\" (backslash) with
   the username exactly as it appears in the **Setting Up
   ActiveSync** window. Then enter your password and the Exchange
   server exactly as it appears in the **Setting Up ActiveSync** window.

7. On the following screen, select **OK**. Next, select all that apply
   to you and on the last screen, give your account a name.

If everything was done correctly, mail will start populating in your inbox.

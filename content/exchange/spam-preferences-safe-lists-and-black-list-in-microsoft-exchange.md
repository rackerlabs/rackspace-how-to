Rackspace gives users the flexibility to set their own spam
preferences. This includes editing and managing
domain-wide spam settings, Safe list, Black List, and the ability to
override the spam filtering for the entire domain.

### Manage Domain Spam Settings

1. To manage your domain spam settings, select **Set Preferences** under
   **Spam Filtering** in the Rackspace Email Box.

   **Note:** If you have multiple domains you may be prompted to select the
   domain you intend to make changes to first.

2. Select either **Entire domain** or **Individual Microsoft
   Exchange Mailbox**.

  **Note:** If you selected **Individual Rackspace Email Mailbox**, select the
  mailbox you intend to make changes to.

3. In the **Settings** section, select whether you'd like to turn the spam
   filtering on or off. You may also select the Exclusive button to receive
   email only from senders on your domain's safelist if you desire.

   settings only to those users who have not already set their spam preferences
   or to override spam preferences for all users. When you're finished,
   select the **Save** button.

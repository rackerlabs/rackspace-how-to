Service books determine which services are
available on your BlackBerry&reg; device.  At times, the service books
become corrupt and can cause the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) to
fail upon synchronizing updates of PIM data such as calendar or address
book entries. These issues are frequently resolved by deleting and
resending the service books to the device. If this happens to a user,
have the user delete
all their service books starting with the &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; from their Blackberry
device. After all service books are deleted,
resend the service books from your Cloud Office
control panel.

### Delete service books

To delete the service books, follow the steps for your model of Blackberry:

#### Blackberry Curve

1. Choose **Device Settings** &gt; **Options** &gt; **Advanced Options**.
2. Click **Service Books** and highlight a service book.
3. Press the **Menu** key, click **Delete** and confirm **Delete**.

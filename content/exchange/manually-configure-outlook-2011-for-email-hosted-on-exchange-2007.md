This article describes how to set up your
Microsoft Exchange 2007 mailbox
to work with your
Microsoft Outlook 2011 email client.


1. Login to your user control panel
   ([cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp)). Under
   the **Client Setup** section, select **Outlook 2011**. This will
   contain some information that you need to set up your account.

2. Open Outlook and, from the Outlook drop-down menu,
   select **Preferences**. In the **Outlook Preferences** menu,
   select **Accounts**.

   - Email address - enter your entire email address
     (for example, myname@example.com).

   - Method - select **User Name and Password**.

   - Username - enter your entire email address
     (for example, myname@example.com).

5. Select **Add Account** and confirm that the amber-colored dot next to the
   account name turns from an amber color to a solid green color. (this may take a
   moment). Close all windows and you're done!

**Note:** The amber dot may take a minute or two to change from amber to
green; if it doesn't change, check the accounts settings and password and make
sure you're using the correct EWS server address.

**Note:** If you already
have email on the server, your email will slowly begin to populate your
inbox. This can take some time depending on how much data you have.

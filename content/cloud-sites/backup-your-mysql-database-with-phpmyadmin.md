3. To export the database to a backup file, click **Export**:

   ![phpMyAdmin Export tab](http://c5018549.r49.cf2.rackcdn.com/phpmyadmin-export.png)

4. To save the backup file to your system, click **Save as
   file**.

   When you save the file, you can change the name of the backup file and the
   compression method, or use the defaults. Compression reduces the size of the backup file.
   The recommended compression method is *gzipped*:

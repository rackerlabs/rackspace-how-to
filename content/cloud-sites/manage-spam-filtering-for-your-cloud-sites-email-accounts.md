**Note:** This article refers to a feature that is no longer available
for Cloud Sites. It is provided for legacy support only.

Basic spam filtering is set up and enabled for all of your email
accounts through Cloud Sites. If the spam filtering software suspects
that an incoming message is spam, it sends the message to the Spam
folder or prefixes the message with `[SPAM]`, depending on your email
settings.

You can change how spam messages are handled within the [webmail interface](http://mail.emailsrvr.com) and from the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).

### Edit spam filtering for a domain

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control
    Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).
2.  In the left navigation pane, click **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.
3.  Click the name of the website for which you want to modify spam
    settings, and then click the **Email Accounts** tab.
4.  Customize domain-wide spam settings in the **Spam
    Settings** section.
5.  Click **Save**.

### Edit spam filtering for an email account

1.  Log in to [webmail](http://mail.emailsrvr.com) for the
    email account.
2.  Click the **Settings** link in the top-right corner.
3.  Click the **Manage spam options** link in the left menu.
    You can also manage your white/black list there.

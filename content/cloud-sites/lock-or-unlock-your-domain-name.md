To lock or unlock your domain, contact the company through which you
have registered your domain. If you purchased your domain through Cloud
Sites, you can contact the Support team to have the domain locked or
unlocked.

If you are unsure who your domain registrar is, perform
a WHOIS lookup on your domain. The results should have a section such as
**ICANN Registrar: YOUR\_REGISTRAR**, which is the company that you need
to contact.

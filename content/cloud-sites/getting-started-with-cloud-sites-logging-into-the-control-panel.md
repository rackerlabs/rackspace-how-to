**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites)

Now that your account has been activated, the first thing that you'll
want to do is to log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/) to access your account.

-   Just open a browser to:
     [http://manage.rackspacecloud.com](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/)

  <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-logging-into-the-control-panel/login2.png %}" alt="" />

-   Log in with the username & password that you selected when you
    created the account. Those credentials are only for accessing the
    Control Panel.

The Control Panel has 3 main sections

1.  **The Left Navigation menu** (green box)
2.  **Details Section** (blue box)
3.  **Cloud News** (purple box)

#### Left navigation menu

Your "Go To" menu, where you access all your assets, support, and manage
account information.

-   **Home** - Takes you to the Welcome page with Account Activity
    Summary displayed.

  <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-logging-into-the-control-panel/gettingstartedhighlight.png %}" alt="" />

  Click on the tab labeled **Getting Started** from the Welcome screen.

  This will show you a brief overview of some key concepts for our
products, and is a handy 'quick-reference' guide.

-   **Hosting** - Create and manage your devices and services like Cloud
    Files, Cloud Servers, and Cloud Load Balancers.  The Client tab is
    for setting up clients, client plans, and messages for Cloud Sites
    resellers

    your [billing](/how-to/billing-services-overview),
    account information, and API key.

  <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-logging-into-the-control-panel/YourAccount.png %}" alt="" />

-   **Support** - Access all of our support resources - Developer
    Guides, Cloud Status, Rackspace How-To, Problem Ticketing System,
    and Live Chat.  All these resources are also available from links at
    the top of the page.

-   **Logout** - Logout of the control panel.

#### Details section

This dynamic section displays the specific data associated with your
selections from the left navigation menu.

#### Cloud news

This dynamic section viewable from the Home Screen will show the latest
news including new features releases, pricing updates, industry news,
and strategic initiatives. This is NOT the place to see maintenance
announcements.  Any news of service impacting events will still be
reported from the [Cloud Status](http://status.rackspacecloud.com/) page.

That just about covers the basic navigation of the Control Panel. In
the next article, Accessing Billing Information, you will learn the
details of the Billing portion of your Control Panel.

**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

If you want to purchase a domain but are not ready to use it for a
website, you can "park" the domain. A parked domain is a domain that is
registered but doesn't point to a website. You always have the option to
point the domain to a website at a later date.

### To register a parked domain with Cloud Sites

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com).
2.  In the left navigation pane, click **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.
3.  Click **Add A Site**.
4.  In the Add a New Website dialog box, select the site owner and enter
    the domain name, and then click **Add New Site**.
5.  Select the term length for the purchase of the domain.
6.  Under **Other Options**, select **Domain Registration Only
    (park domain)** and click **Next**.

You should receive confirmation that Cloud Sites has added your website
to your account.

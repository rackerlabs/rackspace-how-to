**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

You can use various methods to change your FTP password. This article
provides instructions for two recommended methods.

### Change a forgotten password

Use this recommended method if you are locked out of your account or to
reset your password if you have forgotten it.

1.  Go to the login page for the Cloud Sites Control Panel at
    <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com>. If you are already logged in,
    click **Logout** in the left navigation pane.
2.  Click the **Lost your password?** link under the **Password**
    text box.
3.  Enter your user name in the **Username** text box.

An email with instructions for resetting your password is sent to the
email address associated with your user name. Your new password will be
required to log in to the Cloud Sites Control Panel and to upload
content to your site via FTP.

### Change your password regularly

Use this recommended method if you are updating your password as a
regular security practice and have no trouble logging in to the Classic
Cloud Control Panel.

1.  Log in to the Cloud Sites Control Panel at
    <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com>.
2.  In the left navigation pane, click **Your Account > Username &
    Contacts**.
3.  In the **Your Username & Password** section, click **Change
    Password**.

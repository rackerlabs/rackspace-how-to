Using your [Cloud Sites Email Control Panel](https://cloudsites.mycpsrvr.com), you can manage both safelists and blacklists, adding a sender's email address, domain, or IP address to the appropriate mailbox- or domain-level lists.

### Manage safelists

Safelists allow you to add a sender's email address, domain, or IP address to a list that delivers directly to the mailbox. This action is useful when a sender is flagged as spam but you don't want the sender's email to be delivered to the **spam** or **junk** folder.

To access the safelists for individual mailboxes, click **Safelists** in the **Email Hosting** section. To access the safelists for mailboxes in the entire domain, click **Safelists** in the **Domains** section.

#### Add email addresses, domains, and IP addresses

1. Enter the email address, domain, or IP address or range in the box.

2. Click **Add**.

    **Note:** If you have multiple email addresses, domain names, or IP addresses to add, use the bulk import option to upload a **.csv** or **.txt** file containing the information.

3. Click **Save**.

#### Remove email addresses, domains, and IP addresses

1. Select email address, domain, or IP address or range from the list.

2. Click **Remove**.

    To remove all email addresses, domain names, or IP addresses or ranges listed in the window, click **Clear**.

3. Click **Save**.

### Manage blacklists

Blacklists allow you to block a sender's email address, domain, or IP
address from delivering to a mailbox. Objects that are blacklisted
are not delivered to the mailbox.

To access the blacklist for individual mailboxes, click **Blacklists** in the **Email Hosting** section. To access the blacklist for mailboxes in the entire domain, click **Safelists** in the **Domains** section.

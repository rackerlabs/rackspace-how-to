This article will show you how to install OSCommerce version 2.2 onto
your site with The Rackspace Cloud. Please note that this article
assumes you have already selected either PHP4 or PHP5 as your default
technology, you have already setup a MySQL database in the control
panel, you have uploaded the OSCommerce application files to your site.

Please see the following articles on how you change your default
technology, add a MySQL database, and connect to FTP:

-   [How do I change my site's default technology?](/how-to/change-your-sites-default-technology)
-   [How do I add a MySQL database to my site?](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mysql-databases)
-   [How do I add content to my website?](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-ftpsshfsftp-clients)

1.  Open your browser and enter your domain's URL and include the
    "catalog" directory in the path if you left it as is
    (**http://www.example.com/catalog**).
2.  The OSCommerce installation wizard will load and ask you to update
    any required permissions on the site's files. Once you have updated
    the permissions, click on the **Retry** button. If successful, a
    Continue button will then be available to proceed.
3.  You will now be asked to enter your database
    configuration information. Click **Continue** once finished. OSCommerce
    will then import the database for you. Click **Continue** to proceed.
4.  Verify that the paths listed are correct for your site. Click
    **Continue** to proceed.
5.  You will now enter your store settings. Verify you have entered the
    correct information and click **Continue** to proceed.

The installation will now be complete and you will be presented with an
option to go to the site's catalog or to the administration tool.

### Now available in Cloud Sites - MySQL 5.1!

Read on to learn the process of migrating your current Cloud Sites
running MySQL 5.0 to begin running on a MySQL 5.1 database.

Migrating your sites to a newer version of MySQL will require a
maintenance period during which your sites will be unavailable.  To
minimize the impact of the migration, you just need to plan ahead and
control the timing and presentation of your site during the process.Here
is an easy-to-follow, five-step process for migrating a MySQL 5.0
database to a MySQL 5.1 database:

1.  Begin by putting up a splash page on your site stating that you are
currently migrating and then revoke all user access to the database
to be migrated. You can successfully revoke access to the database
by using your administrative privileges to rename the configuration
file containing your database link information to a filename with
the `.mig` extension.

  An example would be naming the **config.php** file to **config.php.mig**. After the filename is changed, wait for user transactions to be completed or kill them. Threads can be killed
with the `KILL` statement.

  To learn more, consult the MySQL documentation from their website and see the section [KILL Syntax](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/kill.html). To determine if all user connections have been
completed or successfully killed, use the command `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST`.

  To learn more about this command, please consult the MySQL documentation from their website and look for the section [SHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show-processlist.html).

2.  Proceed to backing up your current MySQL 5.0 database.

  You may wish to use the the process we describe in the How-to article: [How to backup your MySQL database with phpMyAdmin](/how-to/backup-your-mysql-database-with-phpmyadmin).

3.  You will next need to provision a new MySQL 5.1 database to contain the newly migrated database.  

  Do this by following the instructions in our How-to article: [Adding a MySQL Database](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mysql-databases).

4.  The next step is to import your saved database backup into your newly provisioned MySQL 5.1 database.

  You should be able to use the [PHPmyAdmin Database Management Interface](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-phpmyadmin-database-management-interface) to handle imports for databases which are less than 16MB in size without issue. There may be times where you need to import more than 16MB of data, in which case you should follow the directions in the [Cloud Sites FAQ](/how-to/cloud-sites-faq).

5.  Finally, you will need to modify all references in your code/configuration files from the old database server host name, IP address, username, and password to the respective new locations and values on the newly provisioned and migrated database server.

  Rename the config file back to its original name without the *.mig* extension.  Assuming your new user information is valid, the site should begin processing against the new database in the same manner as before.

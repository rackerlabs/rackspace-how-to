Updating your existing SSL Certificate is a quick and simple process.
Whether your SSL Certificate is expiring or you are simply needing to
change to a new SSL Certificate, you can follow these instructions to
get your SSL updated and installed quickly.

**Attention MyRack users:** To update the SSL certificates for your
environment, follow the instructions in the [Reissuing your Rackspace SSL Certificates](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/43/t/4478)
article posted in the Rackspace Support forum.

### Getting Started

In order to update or renew your SSL Certificate, you will need your
CSR. If you don't have your CSR saved, please contact support to have a
new one generated. You can contact our Fanatical Support through a
ticket, live chat or via phone and we can assist you with obtaining this
information.

### Renewing Your Certificate

Next, you will need to update/renew your SSL Certificate. SSL
Certificates are available from a number of third party sources. Some
recommended sellers are:

-  [RapidSSL](http://www.rapidssl.com)
-  [Geotrust](http://www.geotrust.com)
-  [Verisign](http://www.verisign.com)

Follow your vendor's SSL Certificate renewal process; in particular you
may require the following details:

-   **Server type**: Apache 2.4
-   **SSL type**: OpenSSL (some vendors label this modSSL)
-   **CSR**

Once you have completed your certificate renewal, you're ready to install the new certificate.

### Installing the Certificate

In order to install your new SSL certificate, you will need the following information:

1.  Certificate
2.  Private Key
3.  Intermediate Certificate (Typically supplied in a separate file from
    the vendor)

Once you have the above information, you can install your new
certificate by clicking on the **Security** tab of your site, then click on
the **Edit Certificate link**:

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/update-an-existing-ssl-certificate/Edit%20Certificate.png %}" alt="" />

On the next screen, you will see three fields for Certificate, Private
Key, and Intermediate Certificate; simply replace the current
information with your updated info and hit save.

### DNS Update

Because you are updating an existing SSL certificate, you will not need
to wait for propagation as you would when installing a new SSL
Certificate.

**NOTE**: Removing the SSL certificate from your site will change its IP address, which can require a DNS change.

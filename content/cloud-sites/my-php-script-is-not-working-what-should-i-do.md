If your PHP script is not working, check the following:

1. Did you save it as a file with the ".php" extension?

2. Did you upload it to the correct folder on the server?

3. Did you upload it in ASCII?

If you've tried all of the above and your script still isn't working, you
can verify that PHP is indeed installed and working by running `PHPinfo`.

If you check all of these without success please contact a support
specialist. You can also find additional help at the following websites:

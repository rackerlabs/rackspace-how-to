**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

### Previous section

[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites).

Now that you are familiar with how to manage all of your account
details under the **Your Account** tab, the
next section shows you how to get Fanatical Support through our many
support channels.

-   When you log into the control panel, in the **Getting Help**
    section, you will see a link to **Live Chat**. In addition, our
    support telephone number is provided along with links to helpful
    documentation and the community forum.

-   You will also notice that the **Cloud Status**, **Knowledge Base**,
    **Rackspace Community**, **Tickets**, and **Live Chat** links are available
    across the top menu of all pages, as well as the Support phone
    numbers for the United States and United Kingdom. If you are ever
    experiencing a critical problem and need immediate support, please
    call as at one of these numbers:
    -   **United States 24-hour Support:**  800-961-4454
    -   **United Kingdom 24-hour Support:**  0800-083-3012
    -   **International:** 1-210-312-4000

-   **Cloud Status** - Having a problem getting to
    the Control Panel, or any other Rackspace Cloud services? The first
    place you should check is the Cloud Status page. This is where we
    list all maintenances and service impacting events. There is a
    different Status page for **Cloud Sites**, **Cloud Servers**, and **Email**. This is because a
    maintenance or outage may only be impacting one product, while
    others remain unaffected.   

-   **Rackspace How-to** - This
    valuable resource contains numerous articles, tutorials,
    and white papers to help you find all available
    information on using the Rackspace Cloud.  How do we know it's
    valuable? Because ***you are using it right now!***  You can get to Rackspace How-to directly by going to: [https://support.rackspace.com/how-to](/how-to/)
    If you already know what you are looking for, the easiest way
    to find it is to enter keywords in the "Search our Support Network" bar at the top.

-   **Tickets** - the best way to communicate with
    our Support Technicians and provide specific details about a problem
    that you are experiencing is by opening a ticket. The advantage of
    using a ticket is that it allows you to copy & paste or attach (20
    MB limit) cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log
    entries directly into the ticket.  As you can imagine, trying to
    communicate this information over the phone is problematic at best.

-   **Live Chat** - We have Support Technicians
    standing by 24 hours a day to answer any questions you have. Under
    the Live Chat link, you will be directed into a Live Chat session
    with specialists trained to support our various products. Choose
    the appropriate Live Chat link for the product you need
    assistance with.

With all the support resources and support staff made available to you,
it's no wonder why Rackspace is known as the home of Fanatical Support! This completes our tour of the Control Panel.

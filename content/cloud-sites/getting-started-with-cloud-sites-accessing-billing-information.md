[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites)

After logging in to the Control Panel, you might be wondering about how
billing for our Cloud Services works.

When using Rackspace Cloud Sites, your credit card will first be charged
when you first sign up for the account. Your 30-day billing cycle
begins on the day that you activate your account. After 30 days have
elapsed, you will then be billed for the next month of service. The
exact amount may vary as it is based on recurring charges in addition to
whatever one-time fees you have incurred during the previous month.

This article will provide you with an overview of the billing resources
available to you through our website and your Control Panel.  You can
use the following resources to help you manage and track the billing for
your account:

### Pricing pages and cost calculator

Each of the product pages on our website contains the most current
pricing list, and each also has a cost calculator to assist you in
estimating your monthly charges.

-   [Cloud Servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/)
-   [Cloud Load Balancers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing)
-   [Cloud Sites](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites)
-   [Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files)

### Reports

In the Cloud Sites Control Panel, you can access usage data by clicking
**Your Account > Reports** in the left navigation pane.
The **Reports** section opens to the **Usage Data** tab.

The **Usage Data** tab displays a usage summary for your account during
the current billing period, up to 48 hours prior to the the current day.

-   In the top section, you can choose the current or previous billing
    periods to review your account usage.
-   The middle section shows the Actual Daily Usage for bandwidth,
    compute cycles, and disk space across the billing cycle.
-   The bottom section shows you the Daily Usage by sub account. If you
    do not have any sub accounts, it will display your main account
    totals.  It shows usage for site files, Mysql and MSSQL databases,
    bandwidth, and compute cycles. Clicking on the column titles will
    sort the information below.

### Billing

You can access billing information for Cloud Sites by clicking **Your
Account > Billing** in the Cloud Sites Control Panel. This action
opens the **Billing & Payments** section of the Cloud Control Panel.
This section displays important information like your total outstanding
balance, the date of your most recent invoice, and which credit card is
being used for payments on the account.

-   The **Recent Activity** section lists a summary of your most
    recent invoice. This summary includes the date and amount of your
    most recent invoice and your current balance.
-   In the **Payment Information** section, you can update your billing
    information and change the credit card attached to the account.
-   The **Billing History** section displays a summary of your
    invoice history. Click an ID number for an invoice to view
    additional information or download the invoice in your
    preferred format.

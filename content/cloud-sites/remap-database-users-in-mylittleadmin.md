Microsoft SQL Server has two logical layers of security.

-   The term *login* refers to the account at the server level.
-   The term *user* refers to the account that exists inside
    the database.

When you restore a database from one server to another server, you
effectively sever the mapping between the server-level login and the
database-level user.

All databases have a single owner that is assigned to a server-level
login. That special owner login is mapped to the a special database user
called **dbo**. The owner login account and password is the primary
administrative account for your database.

You might need to re-establish the mappings between the server-level
logins and the database users for the new database to be accessible.

Your new server-level logins are found in your Rackspace Cloud Control
Panel under your SQL Server 2008 Database.

**Note:** For additional login to user mappings that are not the special
owner account, you can use the following command:

    ALTER USER [123456_olduser] WITH LOGIN = [123456_newlogin]

### Remap database users to logins

1.  To manage your SQL Server database, [log in to the online manager (myLittleAdmin)](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mylittleadmin-database-management-interface).
2.  Click **Tools > New Query**.
3.  Enter the following command to reassign ownership to the new login
    that you created in the control panel (the brackets are required).
    Replace your database name and login name.

        ALTER AUTHORIZATION
        ON Database::[123456_database]
        TO [123456_login]

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/remap-database-users-in-mylittleadmin/mssql2.jpg %}" alt="mssql2.jpg" />

4.  Verify that the command worked by going to your database and viewing
    the properties.

    The login should now be listed as the new owner.

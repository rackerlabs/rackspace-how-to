**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

The Cloud Sites Control Panel provides a URL that you can use to test
your website before you change the DNS of your domain. Access the URL as
follows:

1.  In the left navigation pane of the Cloud Sites Control Panel, click
    **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.
2.  Click the name of the site that you want to test.

The test URL is located on the **General Settings** tab, under **Viewing
and Editing**. The link is your full domain name followed by the cluster
of the default technology that you chose when you added the site, such
as **.php5-1** or **.asp1-1**, followed by **websitetestlink.com**.

For example:

-   http://www.domain.com.php5-1.websitetestlink.com
-   http://www.domain.com.asp1-1.websitetestlink.com

The test links are generated according to the cluster and default
technology on which your domain resides, so your specific test URL might
be different from the examples.

For information about how to add content to your test website by using
the test FTP, see [Getting Started With Cloud Sites, FTP/SSHFS/FTP Clients](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-ftpsshfsftp-clients).

###Adding or Editing Multiple Mailboxes###

To **ADD** multiple mailboxes at one time (up to 500), you will need to first create a CSV or Excel file containing the required data about each mailbox.   Download and edit the template provided in the Email Control Panel.

The first line, the column headers, must remain unedited.  However, the rest of the headers are optional.  The required fields are indicated in bold: **Username, Password, Enabled** (1=Enabled, 0=Disabled), First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name, Alternate Email, Organization, Department, Title, Mobile Phone Number, Business Phone Number, Street, City, State, Postal Code, Country, Notes, UserID, CustomID

**NOTE:** These changes will only affect mailboxes specified in the uploaded file.

However, the **Username, Password,** and **Enabled** fields are required for each mailbox being updated.

Email sent to you from domains, email addresses, and IP addresses on
your blacklist are blocked and are not delivered to your mailbox. To
manage your blacklist, perform the following steps:

1. In the upper-right corner of the webmail window, click the
   **Settings** link.

2. In the left pane, click **Spam Settings**.  

3. Click the **Blacklist** tab.  

To add a domain or email address to the list of domains and email
   addresses that are blacklisted, perform the following steps.  

1. Under the **Blacklisted Domains & Email Addresses** box, click
**Add**.  

2. Enter a domain or email address in the space provided.  
You can use a percent sign (%) as a wildcard in the domain or
email address (for example, **@%.ru**).  

    **Note:** We recommend that you *do not* blacklist domains from
    large email systems, such as hotmail.com or yahoo.com, because
    doing so could prevent you from receiving legitimate email.  

3. Click **Add**.  

To add an IP address to the list of IP addresses that are
blacklisted, perform the following steps:

1. Under the **Blacklisted IP Addresses** box, click **Add**.  

2. Enter an IP address or IP address range in the space provided.
You can use a percent sign (%) as a wildcard in the last three
octets to specify IP address ranges. For example, 216.12.34.%,
216.12.%.%, and 216.%.%.% are all valid ranges.  

3. Click **Add**.  

4. Click **Save**.

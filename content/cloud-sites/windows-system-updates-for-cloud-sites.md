Microsoft is currently on a comprehensive once-a-month release of
security updates. Microsoft releases updates on the second Tuesday of
each month. Immediately after each Microsoft release, Rackspace will
proceed to test the updates internally. Once the updates have been
tested and approved by our Engineering teams, Rackspace will update our
systems.

The Rackspace update schedule for security updates, service packs,
hot-fixes and hardware BIOS, firmware and drivers is:

1.  Microsoft releases security bulletins on the second Tuesday of
    each month.
2.  Rackspace will proceed to test the updates internally.
3.  Once the updates have passed our internal QA, they will be approved
    for release on a monthly basis. Unless an issue is discovered that
    was not found during testing, all systems will have the updates
    applied before the next monthly release.

### Application and Server updates

Any update that affects the web application framework (ASP.NET, ASP and
SQL) will be communicated to customers before they are deployed to our
environment. This is intended to allow customers proper time to test
functional with existing code and make any adjustments necessary to
function under the new updates.

### Critical Updates

From time to time Microsoft determines that an update is too critical to
wait for the regular update release (for example zero days exploit
vulnerabilities). These updates are handled by Rackspace on a case by
case basis. These emergency updates are applied within as quickly as
possible from when they are released once they are verified with
Microsoft as an immediate security risk. Customers will be notified of
the scheduled critical update run at which time these updates become
known.

**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

To renew the domain name for your Cloud Sites domain that you purchased
from Rackspace, use the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com "http://manage.rackspacecloud.com").
2.  In the left navigation pane, click **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.
3.  Click on the domain name that you want to renew.
4.  On the **DNS** tab, click on the **Renew** button.
    If the **Renew** button is not visible, see the note that follows
    these steps.
5.  Select the term (in years) that you want to renew for, and then
    click **Next**.
6.  Click **Finish** to confirm the charges and complete the renewal.

**Notes:**

If the **Renew** button is not visible for a Cloud Site domain that you
know you purchased from Rackspace (**Click and Name** is shown as the
registrar when you perform a WHOIS lookup), you can log in to
<http://manage.opensrs.net> with your original password and update the
password in this control panel to reflect your current password.
Updating the password should re-establish the renew functionality.

Note that if you changed your main account password or client's account
password since you created either account, the preceding step might not
work.

Clients do not have the ability to renew their domain name from the
control panel if the domain name has already expired. Instead, they must
contact Support.

If you require clarification on this process, contact Support through
phone, chat, or ticket.

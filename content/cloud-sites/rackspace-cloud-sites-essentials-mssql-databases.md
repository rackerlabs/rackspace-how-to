In this article we are going to learn how to add a MSSQL database to
your website in Cloud Sites. The process is fairly simple so let's
jump in and add our first database.

1.  First, log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com).
2.  Navigate to **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.

5.  In the **Databases** section click **Add** button.
6.  Enter a **database name**.
7.  Choose a database type as SQL_Server_2008 and click **Continue**.

  **Note:** The prefix of the database name is generated for the user by
Cloud Sites. The database name is a combination of the prefix and the
identifier.

8.  Provide a database **user name**, a **password** and then
    click **Finish**.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mssql-databases/databaseuser.png %}" alt="" />

  **Note:** The prefix of the database user name is generated by Cloud
Sites. The database user name will be a combination of the prefix and
the identifier.

9.  A clock icon is displayed while the database completes setup, click
    on the **Features tab** to refresh status.

    <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mssql-databases/pendingdatabase.png %}" alt="" />

10.  Confirm that the new database is active verifying that the status column has a **green check mark** icon next to the database name.

  **Note:** This process can take a few moments to complete. If your
database does not have a green check mark next to it in excess of 10
minutes and you are still experiencing a problem, please do not hesitate
to contact our technical support 24x7 via phone, chat or by submitting a
ticket through your control panel.

Congratulations! You have added a Microsoft SQL database to your
website! In the next article we will learn how to start working with the
new MSSQL database.

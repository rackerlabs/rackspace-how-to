### What is changing?

Within our DFW datacenter, Cloud Sites will be updating existing MySQL
databases to MariaDB 10.0 which is a highly compatible, drop in
replacement for MySQL. This maintenance allows Cloud Sites to continue
to evolve and provide a more secure and reliable infrastructure for our
customers. Below are the upcoming changes:

-   Existing MySQL databases will be upgraded to Maria DB 10.0
-   External IPs used to manage your database will change. Please refer
    to the Control Panel for the new IP.
-   We will be deploying the latest version of phpMyAdmin for MySQL
    web administration.
-   URLs to access these services will be changing. Please refer to the
    table below for information on the new URL.
-   The URLs for site management will be available after September 1st.

### What is not changing?

-   Plugins and database connectors that utilize your DB will not need
    to be updated. Maria DB is a drop in replacement for MySQL
-   We will create an alias from the old hostname to the new
    hostname automatically.

    **Note:** In the future we will deprecate the
    former hostnames at end of Q2 2016
-   Cloud Database instances are not subject to this migration (Note:
    Our outbound IPs will be changing, if you are using any IP based
    ACLs on external resources, please see
    [here](/how-to/information-for-customer-ip-addresses-and-dns)

### FAQ

#### MySQL Workbench stopped connecting after the maintenance. What could have occurred?

-   External database Management IPs will be changing. These IPs will be
    visible in your control panel's page within the database section.

#### How do I reference my database IP information?

-   Log into your Cloud Sites control panel
    at [manage.rackspacecloud.com](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com)
-   Click on **Hosting > Cloud Sites** and select the domain
    under which the database was created
-   From the domain details page click on the **Features** tab and select
    the active database you wish to reference:

  <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/information-for-mysql-users-mariadb-100/MySQL.png %}" alt="" />

#### Will my database content be affected after the maintenance?

-   No. Data will not be modified during the maintenance. Only Hostname
    and IP information will be changing

#### Will my former hostname information be affected after the maintenance?

-   External IPs for your instances will be updated and the former IPs
    will no longer be usable for connection strings
-   Former hostnames will automatically be aliased to the new database
    host

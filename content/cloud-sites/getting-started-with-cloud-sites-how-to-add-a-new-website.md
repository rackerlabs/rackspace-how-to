**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

### Previous section

[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites)

This article will show you how to create your domain through the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).

-   Let's get started by first logging into the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).
-   After we're logged in, navigate to **Hosting > Cloud Sites**

  <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-how-to-add-a-new-website/cloudsites.png %}" alt="" />

-   Now let's click on the **Add A Site** button shown in the image
    below

  ![](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/addasite.png

-   We'll now have a pop-up menu that will ask us two things:

    1.  Who is this website for?
    2.  What is the domain name?

 <img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-how-to-add-a-new-website/namesite.png %}" alt="" />

-   Once you've selected who the website will be for, and you've entered
    your new domain name, proceed by clicking **Add New Site**
-   Next, depending on the domain name you are trying to add, you could
    be presented with one out of three different screens. You will
    either be asked to register your new domain name, pick a different
    domain name or that the domain name cannot be automatically
    registered or transferred. Let's take a look at each of these
    below:

### Register new domain name

[<img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-how-to-add-a-new-website/registerdomain.png %}" title="Click here to view full size image" width="600" />](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/registerdomain.png)

-   If the domain name is available, you will be asked to register the
    domain name. You also have the option to choose the domain name
    without registering it.

    **Note:** If you choose not to register your domain name, it will not be accessible for pubic viewing on the Internet.

-   Once you have made your selection, click **Next Step** to proceed

### Domain name already exists

If you get the message that the domain is already taken, this means that
someone has already setup this domain name on the Rackspace Cloud and it
cannot be duplicated in our system. You can try a different domain name
in the box below *Domain Name* and click **Continue** to proceed.

### Domain cannot be automatically registered Or transferred

If you get the message that *the domain cannot be automatically
registered or transferred*, this means that the domain has **already
been registered** and is not currently available to be transferred to
the Rackspace Cloud. If you are the owner of the domain do not worry,
**you can still proceed** with adding the domain to the Rackspace Cloud
by clicking on **Continue**.

-   You can proceed by simply clicking in the box next to *"I already
    own this domain"*, and then clicking on **Next Step**

We're almost done! The only steps left will be to choose our websites
default technology and any additional features you may need such as a
database.

-   The next page will offer you 3 different options. The first option
    will allow you to add Microsoft SQL Server Storage space.

-   Below that, you will be able to choose a number of Databases you
    would like.

[<img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-how-to-add-a-new-website/numberofdatabases.png %}" title="Click here to view full size image" alt="Click here to view full size image" width="600" />](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/numberofdatabases.png)

-   The last section will be where you will choose your websites
    default technology. For an extensive breakdown on the available
    technology in Cloud Sites, please click

-   Click on **Next Step** to proceed once you have made your selections.

-   Last, you will review your order, and click on **Finish** once you
    have verified everything is correct. If you would like to make any
    changes to your new domain order, click on **Back**

**Note:** You may incur charges depending on whether you are
registering or transferring a domain to the Rackspace Cloud. You may
also incur additional charges if you have chosen to add Microsoft SQL
Storage Space to your new website. Please use this review screen to
ensure your order is accurate before choosing Finish to begin
provisioning your new website. If you would like to view our current
price guide for registering, transferring domains, or adding additional

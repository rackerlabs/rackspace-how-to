### Previous section

[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites)

This article will show you how to create your domain through the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).

1. Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).
2. Navigate to **Hosting > Cloud Sites**.
3. Click **Add A Site**.
    A pop-up menu opens and ask two things:

      1.  Who is this website for?
      2.  What is the domain name?

4. Selected who the website will be for, enter the new domain name, and then
    click **Add New Site**.

    **Note** depending on the domain name you are trying to add, you could
    be presented with one out of three different screens. You will
    either be asked to register your new domain name, pick a different
    domain name or that the domain name cannot be automatically
    registered or transferred. Let's take a look at each of these
    below:

### Register new domain name

If the domain name is available, you will be asked to register the
domain name. You also have the option to choose the domain name
without registering it.

    **Note:**If you choose not to register your domain name, it will not be accessible for pubic viewing on the Internet.

Once you have made your selection, click **Next Step** to proceed

### Domain name already exists

If you get the message that the domain is already taken, this means that
someone has already setup this domain name on the Rackspace Cloud and it
cannot be duplicated in our system. You can try a different domain name
in the box below *Domain Name* and click **Continue** to proceed.

### Domain cannot be automatically registered Or transferred

If you get the message that *the domain cannot be automatically
registered or transferred*, this means that the domain has **already
been registered** and is not currently available to be transferred to
the Rackspace Cloud. If you are the owner of the domain do not worry,
**you can still proceed** with adding the domain to the Rackspace Cloud
by clicking on **Continue**.

-   Proceed by clicking in the box next to *"I already
    own this domain"*, and then click on **Next Step**

Choose your website's default technology and any additional features you
may need, such as a database.

-   The next page offers 3 different options. The first option
    will allow you to add Microsoft SQL Server Storage space.

-   Below that, choose the number of Databases you want to use.

-   The last section will be where you will choose your websites
    default technology. For an extensive breakdown on the available
    technology in Cloud Sites, please click
    [here](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/technology/).

-   Click **Next Step** to proceed once you have made your selections.

-   Review your order, and click **Finish** once you
    have verified everything is correct. If you would like to make any
    changes to your new domain order, click **Back**.

**Note:** You may incur charges depending on whether you are
registering or transferring a domain to the Rackspace Cloud. You may
also incur additional charges if you have chosen to add Microsoft SQL
Storage Space to your new website. Please use this review screen to
ensure your order is accurate before choosing Finish to begin
provisioning your new website. If you would like to view our current
price guide for registering, transferring domains, or adding additional

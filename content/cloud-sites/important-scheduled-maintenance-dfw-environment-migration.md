### Overview

We are pleased to inform you that in order to better serve your Cloud
Sites offering, Rackspace made a significant investment in new
infrastructure within our Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) datacenter. With this
scheduled migration, some customers may experience brief downtime. With
continued ServiceNet connectivity, this migration allows for upgraded
hardware and software versions, deployment of new features, as well as
lays the groundwork for future enhancements.

### Timeframe

The scheduled maintenance will commence in mid-Q3 with an anticipated
completion of Q4 of 2015.

### Preparation reference material

In order to prepare for upcoming system and feature enhancements, we ask

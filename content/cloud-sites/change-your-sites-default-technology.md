**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

You can change the default technology that your site uses, either IIS
with ASP.NET or Apache web server with PHP.

**Note:** When you change your site's default technology, the IP address
for the site changes. If Rackspace is managing your DNS, the changes are
made automatically but can take up to two hours to take effect. If you
are managing your own DNS, update the IP address for your site. You can
get the new IP address on the **DNS** tab.

1.  Log in to your Cloud Sites Control Panel at
    <http://manage.rackspacecloud.com>.
2.  In the left navigation pane, click **Hosting > Cloud
    Sites**.
3.  Click the domain name for which you want to change the technology.
4.  Click the **Features** tab.
5.  In the **Technologies** section, click **Change Technology**.
6.  From the menu, select the technology that you want to switch to, and
    then click **Change Technology**.

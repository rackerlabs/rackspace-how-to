**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

This article shows how to manually install WordPress on Cloud Sites.

### Prerequisites

-   Administrative access to the Rackspace Cloud to create domains and
    add databases
-   WordPress software from <http://wordpress.org/download/>
    uncompressed in a local repository
-   FTP access to website, and a FTP client like ExpanDrive

### Procedure

1.  Login to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com). If you are new the
    Rackspace Cloud, please refer to the article [Adding a new website](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-how-to-add-a-new-website).

2.  Navigate the **Hosting > Cloud Sites** menu to the website hyperlink on which WordPress is to be
    installed

    **Note:** The domain must have database feature selected. The
    database feature can be added by using the CHANGE PLAN hyperlink on
    the domain **General Settings** tab.

3.  Upload WordPress software files to the desired location on the website using FTP - Refer to [Upload content to a website using FTP](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-uploading-your-content)

4.  To integrate WordPress to the root of domain (e.g.
    **http://example.com/**), place all contents of the uncompressed
    **wordpress** directory (excluding the directory itself) into the
    **/web/content/** directory which is the root directory of the site.

5.  To have the WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on the
    website (e.g. **http://example.com/blog/**), rename the uncompressed
    **wordpress** directory to the name of choice and place it on the
    web server. For e.g. to create a WordPress installation in a
    directory called "blog", rename the directory called "wordpress" to
    "blog" and upload it to the root directory of the web site.

6.  Next create a new Mysql database (e.g. *prefix*\_wp20) with
    user (e.g. *prefix*\_wp20 ).  To create the database within the
    Cloud Sites infrastructure please refer to our article on [Adding a MySQL database to a website or domain](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-sites-essentials-mysql-databases).

    If you prefer to use our Cloud Databases service you can follow the
    instructions in this article on [using Cloud Databases with Cloud Sites](/how-to/using-cloud-databases-with-your-cloud-site).

7.  Note the database information **database name**, **user name**,
    **password**,  and **hostname** (not localhost) for use during the
    WordPress installation. This can be found by clicking on the
    hyperlink for the new database just created in the
    **Databases** section of the website **Features** tab.

8.  Run the WordPress installation script by accessing WordPress for the
    first time in your favorite web browser.

    -   If WordPress files are placed in the root directory, e.g. visit:
    [http://www.example.com/wp-admin/install.ph](http://www.example.com/wp-admin/install.php)p
    -   If WordPress is in its own sub-directory called blog, e.g. visit:
    <http://www.example.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php>
    -   If DNS is not setup for the domain, use the Testing URL provided in the Cloud Sites Control Panel under the General Settings tab, e.g. http://www.example.com.php5-7.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php

With this, Cloud Sites specific steps are complete. Now follow on screen
prompts to continue the installation.

-   Provide the necessary database information recorded during the
    preparation phase and press the **Submit** button
-   Provide details such as blog name, admin email address and press
    the **Install** button
-   Use the generated password to login as admin and then change the
    password if needed.

WordPress should now be fully functional and accessible based on the
install location

-   If WordPress files are placed in the root directory, e.g. visit:
    http://www.example.com
-   If WordPress is in its own subdirectory called blog, e.g. visit:
    http://www.example.com/blog
-   If DNS is not setup for the domain, visit the Testing URL, e.g.
    http://www.example.com.php5-7.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/blog
    provided in the Classic Cloud Control Panel under the General
    Settings tab.

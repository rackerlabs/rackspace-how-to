DNS records are like "phone books" for the Internet and can be very
useful when additional information is needed. They contain information
about every registered domain on the web; such as where email should be
sent and who is the domain's hosting provider. If you host your DNS with
Rackspace, you can manage your DNS Records through the control panel.
Let's take a look at the following steps below to see how this is done:

1. First thing you'll want to do is login to your control panel at
[cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com); once you're logged in
you'll mouse over the **Go to section** drop-down menu and
select **Domains**.

2. In the **Manage** section, click the **DNS Settings** link.

3. Search for the domain for which you want to manage DNS settings and
click on the **DNS Records** link.

4. Next, you will either choose between **Use Rackspace Name
servers** or **Use Custom Name Servers**. By default "**Use
Rackspace Name servers**" will be chosen with entries already
implemented for you. If you would like to use your own, choose **Use
Custom Name Servers**. Make your changes as needed and then select
**Save**.

**Note:** **Use Rackspace Name Servers** must be selected for the Hosting
and Mail Records sections to be visible. To add additional DNS records
click the **Add Additional Record** button.

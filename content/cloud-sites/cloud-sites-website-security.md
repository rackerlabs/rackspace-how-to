### What do you manage?

We manage security for all servers including PHP, .NET, and the
operating systems What do I manage? You are responsible for securing
your website code.

### What security do you specifically provide?

Firewalls at the infrastructure level, DDoS mitigation, antispam and
antivirus (for legacy email accounts only).

### What ports are open for me to use?

All standard ports such as...80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS), 587(SMTP),
465(SMTPS), etc.

### Database Security

On Cloud Sites we fully manage the back-end infrastructure and are
responsible for server-side security, patching, etc.  Your database will
be secure assuming you create a unique database username and secure
strong password and keep this safe.  Your database will be provisioned
on a database cluster separate from the web servers running your
site/application for greater performance and redundancy.

### Can we lock down sub domains with username and password without having to use script or code?

No, if you want password protection you have to set that up in your code
(for folders or groups of folders)

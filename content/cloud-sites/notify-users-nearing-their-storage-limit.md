You can automatically send an email notification to users when their mailbox reaches a certain capacity. The notifications can be sent when a user's mailbox is at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 99 percent. These are the only notification limits that can be set on a per-mailbox level.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Sites Email Control Panel](https://cloudsites.mycpsrvr.com).

1. Click the **Email Hosting** section.

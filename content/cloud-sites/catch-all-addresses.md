A catch-all address receives all email sent to invalid mailboxes at a user's domain and is sometimes used to avoid missing any emails to a domain.

**Warning:** Catch-all addresses are not filtered for spam. Use at your own risk. With this feature enabled, you will receive thousands of spam emails from spammers who guess random addresses within your domain.

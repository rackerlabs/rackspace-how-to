Split domain routing (SDR) allows you to have a single domainâ€™s
mailboxes distributed between our system and an external system, working
together as if they were in one environment. This is primarily used when
a large number of mailboxes are being migrated over to our system from
another server over an extended period of time.

Mailboxes can be moved in batches to make the move more manageable for
administrators and to make the transition almost seamless for the users.
Though it is not common, SDR can also be used when you need to maintain
some mailboxes on an existing system for an extended period of time or
permanently.

**Note:** Please be advised that split domain routing can be a
complicate email setup process and should only be utilized if you are
sure that you need this option turned on for your domain. Also please be
advised that we cannot troubleshoot split domain routing issues for your
domain if you turn on this option through your Cloud Sites Email Control
Panel.

Previously, if billing for your account failed, a message would be
displayed when you logged in to the Cloud Sites Control Panel. The
message stated that there was an issue billing your account and to
contact our Cloud Billing team. This notification method has changed, as
follows.

If the credit card on file for your account is declined, an email is
sent to the billing email address on file. If you receive such an email,
contact the Cloud AR team at US toll free 800-480-2716, and
international 1-210-312-4000. Do not contact the Cloud Billing team.

To see any outstanding balances for your account, perform the follow
steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).
2.  In the upper-right corner of the window, click **Account:
    *userName* > Billing and Payments**.
    The Billing & Payments page appears.
    **Note:** Clicking **Your Account > Billing** in the Cloud
    Sites Control Panel also opens this page in the Cloud Control Panel.
3.  Review any balances listed under **Current Balance**.
    A total is displayed if any balance is due.
4.  Contact the Cloud AR team (not the Cloud Billing team) at US toll
    free 800-480-2716 and international 1-210-312-4000 to discuss any
    balances that are due.

You can automatically send an email notification to users when their mailbox reaches a certain capacity. The notifications can be sent when a user's mailbox is at 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 99%. These are the only notification limits that can be set on a per-mailbox level.

1. Log in to the [**Cloud Sites Email Control Panel**](https://cloudsites.mycpsrvr.com).

1. Click the **Email Hosting** section.

1. Click the **Settings** option.

1. Click the **Storage Notification** section.

1. Select the storage notification percentage.

  **Note:** The default is set to 80%.

1. Click **Save** to save the settings for all users on that domain.

**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

This article provides a simple installer for setting up scheduled
backups via a cron task. The installer will setup all the necessary
files for backing up your site files and database. It will also setup
the Cloud Files API for moving your backups to your Cloud Files storage.

If you want a web-based tool to manage manual and scheduled backups
instead, the [Zipit tool](/how-to/zipit-backup-utility-for-cloud-sites-linux) can
offer that additional functionality.

### Limitations

-   Cloud Sites has a 15 minute limit on anything run via cron task. If
    your site backup takes longer than the 15 minute limit your backups
    will not complete or may result in partial backups.
-   Backups are limited to a total of 4gb.
-   For Linux sites only.

### Installation/Setup

-   Download [this file](https://raw.github.com/jeremehancock/cron-backup-script-setup/master/cron-backup-setup.php) and
    save it to your local machine as **cron-backup-setup.php** without
    the quotes.
-   Upload the cron-backup-setup.php file to the content folder of the
    site you want to backup.
-   Open your web browser and navigate to
    **http://*yourdomain.com*/cron-backup-setup.php** to access
    the installer.

  **Note:** Replace "http://*yourdomain.com*" with your actual
domain name.

-   Enter your database credentials. (Leave this section blank if your
    site does not have a database)

  **Note:** Be sure to use the hostname and not the IP address for your
database.

-   Enter your Cloud Files username and API Key.

-   Click **Install**.

After the installation is complete, you will see one new directory that
contains the Cloud Files API files and two files used to backup your
site. These files will be found in the "root" of your site (ie.
www.yoursite.com directory). Following is a list of the additions to your
site.

1.  cron-backup-api (directory containing API files)
2.  cron-backup.php (main backup file)
3.  cron-backup-config.php (configuration file)

Now that you have the backup script and all necessary files installed
you can setup your cron job to backup your site.

For more information on setting up a cron task in Cloud Sites, see the article [How do I schedule a cron job for Cloud Sites?](/how-to/how-do-i-schedule-a-cron-job-for-cloud-sites)

Here are the basics of what you will use for the cron task:

-   Command Language: php
-   Command to Run: cron-backup.php (You do not need to include any
    path information. Simply put cron-backup.php in this field)

**Note:** It is highly recommended that you choose the option to send the
results via email. This will help ensure that you are aware if your
backups fail for any reason.

Following is a screenshot of the the cron setup in the Cloud Control Panel:

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-sites/scheduled-backup-cloud-sites-to-cloud-files/cron-setup.png %}" alt="" />

That's it! You should now have scheduled backups setup for your Cloud
Site. Your backups can be found within your Cloud Files section of the
[Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

The container for the backups will be named with the following syntax:

-  **domain.com-cron-backups**

The backups will be named with the following syntax:

-  **domain.com-backup-DATE.zip** where DATE is the date that the backup
was taken

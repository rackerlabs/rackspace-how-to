You can use the following methods to set up your domain name to work
with your Cloud Sites web hosting account:

-   [Registering a domain name through the control panel](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-registering-andor-transferring-domain-names)
-   [Transferring the registrar of an existing domain name](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-registering-andor-transferring-domain-names)
-   [Updating your existing name servers to Rackspace name servers](/how-to/getting-started-with-cloud-sites-rackspace-nameservers-and-creating-custom-nameservers)

All DNS changes take up to 48 hours to take effect. During this time you
can check your website by using the *testing URL*, which you can find on
the Cloud Sites Control Panel, on the **General Settings** tab for your
domain.

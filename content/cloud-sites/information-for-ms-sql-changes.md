### What is changing?

-   External IPs used to manage your database will change. Please refer
    to the Control Panel for the new IP address
-   We will be deploying the latest version of My Little Admin (MLA) and
    My Little Backup (MLB) for MSSQL web administration
-   URLs to access these services will be changing, so please refer to
    the table below for more information
-   The URLs for management will be available after September 1^st^
-   Former hostnames will automatically be aliased to the new database
    hosts

**Note:** Old entries (ie., admin links) will be retired by end of Q2
2016

| Current Website Testlink | NEW My Little Admin URL |
| ------------------------ | -----------------------
| Contains DFW1-1 | [https://mssql.dfw3-1.websitesettings.com/mla](https://mssql.dfw3-1.websitesettings.com/mla)
| Contains DFW1-2 | [https://mssql.dfw3-2.websitesettings.com/mla](https://mssql.dfw3-2.websitesettings.com/mla)

### What is not changing?

-   Your version of MSSQL will not be changing. During the maintenance,
    we will be migrating SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2014 over to the
    new environment.
-   We will create an alias from the old hostname to the new
    hostname automatically. **Note:** *In the future we will deprecate
    the former hostnames at end of Q2 2016.*
-   Cloud Database instances are not subject to this migration.

### How does this affect me?

-   Customers using 3rd party utilities (ie. Navicat, SSMS, etc.) will
    need to update the IP address that they use to connect to their
    database for management
-   If a customer is using the management IP for production access to
    their database, we recommend that they make use of our Cloud
    Database offering.

    **Note:** Cloud Sites databases are meant to be used
    with a Cloud Sites websites only.

-   If you have pages bookmarked for web management of your database,
    please be sure to update these accordingly.

Using your [**Cloud Sites Email Control Panel**](https://cloudsites.mycpsrvr.com), you can manage both Safelists
and Blacklists, adding sender’s email address, domains, or IP address to
the appropriate mailbox or domain level lists.

**Manage Safelists**

Safelists allow you to add a sender’s email address, domains, or IP
address to deliver directly to the mailbox. This is useful when a sender
is flagged as spam but you don’t want the sender’s email to be delivered
to the Spam/Junk Folder.

1.  For individual mailboxes, click **Safelists** in the **Email
    > Hosting** section. For the domain, click **Safelists** in the
    > **Domains** section.

address from delivering to your mailbox. Objects that are blacklisted
are not delivered to the mailbox.

Get quick answers to common questions about migrating from Rackspace to AWS.

### General

#### Why are you helping customers move from your public cloud to AWS?

Rackspace provides expertise and support for the world's leading clouds,
including our OpenStack public cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure, along with
multiple private clouds and dedicated servers. Rackspace gives customers a
choice of the leading clouds and helps them find the best fit for each of
their workloads. Rackspace constantly seeks new ways to serve customers, often
starting with a beta program. At the moment, we're working on a beta program
to provide a smoother migration for those of our customers who are interested
in AWS infrastructure and want to continue to tap our expertise, tooling, and
support through our popular Fanatical Support for AWS service.

#### Will you eventually decommission your public cloud?

Rackspace has made no decision to decommission our public cloud. We continue
to invest in it. We are simply making it easier for customers who want to
migrate to AWS infrastructure to do so, while keeping the Rackspace expertise
and support that they value. We also provide expertise and support for customers who use the Microsoft Azure public cloud and our OpenStack public
cloud, as well as various private clouds and dedicated servers. We have no
bias toward any of these infrastructure platforms and form factors, but
instead help customers choose the ones that are best for each of their
workloads. Ultimately, it is our customers who decide how many workloads we
support on each platform.

#### I heard that your sales representatives no longer available to new buyers of your public cloud. Is that correct?

No, that is not correct. We continue to sell our OpenStack public cloud
through sales representatives and through our website.

### Beta migration from Rackspace to AWS

#### How can I take part in the beta migration program or learn more about it?

Like any beta program, this one is limited in the number of customers it can
accommodate. Customers who would like take part in the beta program or learn
more about it should engage with their account manager who will work the
beta program leader to sign you up for the beta migration program.

#### What happens beyond the beta program? Are you considering a decommission then?

See the answer for "Will you eventually decommission your public cloud?".

#### Are you going to be building better migration capabilities for other public clouds such as Azure?

Rackspace is very excited about our Fanatical Support for Azure offering and also about the growth Azure is experiencing. Our assessment is that AWS is the preferred destination for most of our customers who want to migrate today, so our strategy is to begin with solutions in the area with the highest demand.

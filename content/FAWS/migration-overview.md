Rackspace provides an easy self-service migration through the Rackspace Migration Manager. In this initial phase, the Rackspace Migration Manager is built specifically for customer migrations from the Rackspace Public Cloud to Fanatical Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Migration Manager is intuitive and easy to navigate, and provides a quick and secure migration between Rackspace and Fanatical Support for AWS. With a little planning on your part, the Migration Manager steps you easily through the migration process.

The migration process leverages both Rackspace and AWS APIs to securely move resources to the Fanatical Support for AWS cloud. The Rackspace source environment is not impacted as the migration to the Fanatical Support for AWS target environment takes place.

Using the Rackspace Migration Manager, simply select the resources that you want to migrate from the Rackspace Public Cloud to Fanatical Support for AWS. We will provide you with our recommended Fanatical Support for AWS environment setup, but you are free to customize configurations as well. Along the way, the Migration Manager keeps you informed of the current pricing of your selected resources and what you can expect for pricing after you have migrated to Fanatical Support for AWS. Finally, simply schedule the best time for your migration to take place, and track progress as things begin migrating from the migration dashboard within the manager tool.

The following diagram shows the flow of the migration from Rackspace to AWS.

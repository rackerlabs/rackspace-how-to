Rackspace provides an easy self-service migration through the Fanatical Support&reg; migration control panel. The migration control panel was designed and built specifically for customer migrations from the Rackspace cloud to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The control panel is intuitive and easy to navigate and provides a secure migration between Rackspace and AWS. With a little upfront planning on your part, the control panel steps you easily through the migration process.

The migration process leverages Rackspace and AWS APIs to securely move resources to the AWS cloud. The Rackspace source environment is not impacted as the migration to the AWS target environment takes place. (Make sure this is true - have seen some proposing to delete Rax cloud at end of migration.)

In the control panel, select your resources to be migrated after which recommendations for the migration are presented. Current and projected pricing are provided to help you make your selections. Finally, you schedule your migration. A "lift and shift" migration is done at the scheduled time.

The following diagram shows the flow of the migration from Rackspace to AWS.

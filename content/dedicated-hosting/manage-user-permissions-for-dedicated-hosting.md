This article explains user permissions for Dedicated Hosting and shows you
how to manage these permissions.

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions**.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** area in the MyRackspace portal and
modify another userâ€™s permissions, you must have one of the following
permissions:

  - **Account Administrator**: This permission grants a user unlimited access
    to all sections of the MyRackspace portal.

  - **Admin**: This permission (on a device or service) grants a user the
    ability to access and manage the device or service.

### Categories of permissions

The following categories of permissions are available for Dedicated Hosting
accounts:

- **Direct permissions**: The permissions that grant the user direct access to
  account permissions, linked cloud accounts, devices, or services.

- **Effective permissions**: The permissions that a user inherits as a result
  of their memberships in user and product groups.

**Note**: You can grant a user a combination of direct and effective
permissions. MyRackspace uses the highest level of permission granted.

### Methods for assigning permissions

You can assign permissions in the MyRackspace portal in the following ways:

- **Assign by User**: Enables you to select an individual and grant them
  access to account-level permissions, linked cloud accounts, devices,
  services, and product groups.

- **Assign by User Group**: Enables you to select a group of users and
  grant them access to account-level permissions, linked cloud accounts,
  devices, services, and product groups.

- **Assign by Product**: Enables you to select a linked cloud account, device,
  or service and assign users and user groups to that product.

- **Assign by Product Group**: Enables you to select a group of
  accounts, devices, or services and assign users and user groups to that
  product group.

### Manage global permissions

The **Global Permissions** section enables you to make changes across your
entire account.

**Ticketing Settings** enable you to control the tickets that your users have
permission to see when those tickets concern one or more devices.

The following table shows the ticketing settings that are required for common
actions or views:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Ticketing setting</th>
    <th>Functionality</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flexible Ticket Viewing (default setting)</td>
    <td>To enable users to be able to see tickets that include a device that they have permission to view. For example, if a user has access to device A, they see all of the tickets that include device A, even if another device is on the ticket. If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user can still see the ticket.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Strict Ticket Viewing</td>
    <td>To require users to have access to all of the devices on a ticket in order to see that ticket. For example, if a ticket includes device A and device B, then the user must have permissions to both devices to see the ticket. If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user is no longer be able to see the ticket.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### How permissions impact the user experience for tickets

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>View Tickets</b> or <b>Edit Tickets</b> permission</td>
    <td>View or include another user on an account ticket (a ticket that doesn't have a device or service associated with it)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>View</b>, <b>Edit</b>, or <b>Admin</b> permission to that device</td>
    <td>View or include another user on a ticket that has a device associated with it</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>

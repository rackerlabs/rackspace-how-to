This article describes Access Control List (ACL) theory and best practices. These concepts are the pre-requisite knowledge you should have before modifing your environment's access-list rules in Firewall Manager v2.

Firewall Manager v2 is a new tool within the MyRackspace portal. To learn more about the tool, see [Firewall Manager v2](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/firewall-manager-v2).

### Firewall Manager v2 access-list process

To learn more about the access-list process, see [Firewall Manager v2 - Access-list Rules](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/firewall-manager-v2-access-list-rules).

### What is an Access Control List?

Access control lists, or ACLs, give Cisco firewalls basic traffic filtering capabilities. Access-lists have the potential to be configured to filter traffic for all routed protocols as the packets pass through the firewall. One of the key functions to access-lists is to provide security for a network. If access-lists are not used, the Cisco firewall's default security policy of security-levels is active, which does not provide the highest level of network security. Access-lists are the tool that provide environments with Network Access Control, or NAC. They do this by filtering network traffic and controlling if packets are forwarded or blocked at the firewall's interfaces. As an aspect of the deep packet inspection process, Cisco firewalls perform this access control lookup for each packet attempting to traverse one of its interfaces. The primary function of access-lists is to control the traffic that attempts to enter the internal networks from an external, unsecured network. 

### What is an Access Control Entry?

An Access Control Entry (ACE) is an individual entry in an Access Control List (ACL). Access Control Entries are referred to as **Rules** in the Firewall Manager v2. The Cisco firewall only allow you to configure one access-list, per interface, per direction. This access-list can be composed of as many ACEs that you need. The Firewall Manager v2 enables you

### Access-list best practices and recommendations

The security of your Rackspace environment begins at your Cisco firewall. Because of this, misconfigurations in network access policies on your firewall can lead to unwanted network exposure and potential compromise. The integrity and network security of your environment is highly important to Rackspace. 

The following points are some best practices and recommendations you should always follow in order to remain secure and not break any compliances you may need to follow. 

- Always minimize the size of the source and destination traffic in your access-list entry when possible. Be as specific as possible. Do not define the destination as any (your entire Rackspace environment) when only one destination server needs to be accessed.

- Do not allow traffic from any source to any destination of the IP, TCP, or UDP protocols. (**permit ip any any**, **permit tcp any any**, or **permit udp any any**) This will effective turn your security platform into a router, as it will not block any packets to your entire environment over those protocols.

- Do not allow all traffic to a destination or group of destinations. (**permit ip any [host]**, or **permit ip any [object-group]**)

- Do not globally open up ports (defining source of any over a port) that are not considered a generally accepted best practice. Examples of these ports are, but not limited to **22 - SSH**, **1433 - Microsoft SQL**, **3306 - MySQL**, and **3389 - RDP**.

### Access-list line numbers

Cisco firewalls uses line numbers appended to access control entries to identify the execution order of the access-list. When a new access-list rule is created in the Firewall Manager v2, it uses the Cisco default action and automatically appends the line to the bottom of the access-list. Depending on the content of the access-list, this default action may or may not be what you are intending to configure. It is common to have the need to place an access-list rule in a customized location within the access-list.

A scenario where this is needed is when there is an encompassing deny rule above the newly created rule. This would prevent the new rule from ever triggering. Remember, traffic processed by the Cisco ASA is performed by first match, from top down within the access-list applied to the interface. Once a connection that is being inspected matches on an access control entry, the processing for that lookup is ended. Also keep in mind that there is an implicit deny all at the bottom of each access control list. What that means is Cisco firewalls operate using a fail close approach. If traffic is not explicitly permitted, then it is implicitly denied.

### Access-list for DMZs and other back-end segments

A DMZ, or demilitarized zone, is a seperate network segment that is used to physical and logically seperate networks. Our Cisco firewalls use access-lists to perform network access control on DMZs and other back-end segments. It is a best practice when creating multiple segments behind Cisco firewalls to explicitly deny traffic from lower trusted segments to the higher trusted segment. This is considered the generally accepted best practice because it enables your firewall to isolate your inside segment from not only the traffic coming from the internet, but also traffic coming from other segments behind the firewall that lie within your Rackspace environment. 

An example of this is an environment that has a DMZ and INSIDE segment created. An access-list entry would need to be created that denied traffic sourcing from the DMZ segment destined to the INSIDE segment. Any exceptions to this, e.g. Active Directory ports, would be configured above the deny line. This technique allows you to deny all traffic by default and then specify individual access required as you find business needs for resources in the two segments to communicate.

### Access-list Rules

Each environment at Rackspace is unique in its own way. However, there are standards we have implemented in each firewall environment to make some aspects of the access-list configuration uniform.

- **101 ACL**: The 101 access-list is the ACL that is applied to the outside interface for traffic ingressing (coming toward) from the internet. The 101 access-list defines what traffic from the internet is allowed to enter into the environment. The 101 access-list is your Rackspace environment's first line of defense. If traffic is not explicitly permitted on it, traffic is implicitly denied by default.

    **Warning:** The 101 access-list is the gatekeeper for the network security of your environment. Do not open more access than is required. See the _Best Practices_ section above for details.
  
 -  **100** or **inside** or **FW-INSIDE ACL** - The name of this ACL is less standardized. Even though there are a few variations of the name, the purpose is however completely standardized. This access-list is applied to the inside segment for ingressing traffic. This means that this access-list is applied for traffic sourcing from the inside segment (Your Rackspace servers) destined to anything, whether it is the internet or another segment in your environment. The default for this access-list is permit ip any any. This gives your Rackspace servers unfiltered outbound communication, but only if the traffic is initiated by your Rackspace server. This is useful when servers need to communicate outbound for software updates. It is always a Rackspace recommendation that you lockdown the outbound filtering when possible. If you would like to do that, please make a Rackspace support request and mention this portion of the article.

-  **200 and up ACLs** - The Rackspace standard for site to site VPNs is to use a crypto map ACL name starting at 200. Each site to site VPN configuration will increment by 1 from there. Be cautious if you update a VPN ACL. Because the firewall's crypto engine uses this ACl as its means to build the encryption domains and

- **FW-DMZ-SVRS** or **DMZ** or **99 ACL** - This is the ACL dedicated to your DMZ segment. If you have a DMZ, there needs to always be a deny statement preventing the DMZ from communicating the the INSIDE segment. The deny statement prevents intersegment communication. If intersegment communication is required, you will need to create a permit access-list rule and move it to above the encompassing deny statement.

- **nonat** or **102 ACL** - This ACL is dedicated to NAT bypass, or the feature called NAT0. This is used in Cisco firewall code versions below 8.3. On code versions below 8.3, pur Cisco firewalls are configured to _force_ the firewall the NAT a packet when it moves from one interface to another. Occasionally though, you may not want this. An example is when two internal segments are communicating with each other or VPN traffic. If your firewall is on a code version higher than 8.3, this NAT bypass ACL is no longer needed and can be removed. This syntax is likely the remnants of unused configuration after a mass code upgrade.

- **CLIENTVPN** or **ANYCONNECT-VPN** or **103 ACL** - This is the ACL dedicated to your AnyConnect or IPSec client VPN's access. It is possible to have a 2nd ACL applied to individual access further filtering this VPN traffic.

- **RackConnect ACL** - This ACL is dedicated to your RackConnectv2 configuration. RackConnectv2 ACL updates can only occur through the Network Policies section of the RackConnectv2 portal. Currenly, the Firewall Manager v2 does not permit access control entries that contain the RackConnect subnet ranges of 10.76.0.0/12 or 10.208.0.0/12.

- **300** or **PNAT ACL** - This is dedicated to policy NAT ACLs on pre-8.3 software.

- **CLOUD-PAT ACL** - This line is used to PAT (Port Address Translation) your cloud servers environment.

- **"cap"-in "cap"-out ACLs** - These "cap" variation ACLs are used for setting up captures on the firewall. This is typically used as a tool to assist with troubleshooting. Our best practice is to remove these when troubleshooting is complete so whe can keep your configuration clean. These are safe to remove if you see one left behind.

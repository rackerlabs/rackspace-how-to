### Overview

Rackspace is working to make your multi-cloud experience as simple as
possible, and you've told us that the best way to do this is to unify the
way that you access and manage your accounts. We're working to make account
management seamless by unifying our login experience. This process will
involve multiple updates over the coming months as we build towards a single
solution. The first step in this journey is to ensure that your user name
meets the Rackspace uniqueness requirements.

Over the past several months, many of our customers were notified that
they would need to update their user names by September 24, 2018 in order to
meet the uniqueness requirements. If you haven't logged into your account
recently or you forgot to update your username (if you were prompted),
Rackspace has automatically updated your user name to meet the new
requirements.

### Changes to your MyRackspace account as of September 24, 2018

If you were unable to update your user name before September 24, Rackspace
has updated it for you. Your updated user name is in the following format:

_**Current user name + last 4 digits of your account number**_

The following example illustrates how Rackspace has created new user names:

| Previous user name | Account number | New user name |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| johnsmith | 551234 | johnsmith1234 |

### MyRackspace login process

After your username has been updated either by yourself or Rackspace, you can
continue to log in to the MyRackspace portal at
[https://my.rackspace.com](https://my.rackspace.com).

You can find a comparison of the service levels on the [Managed Hosting

### Permissions

#### Why do I need to set up permissions?

Permissions enable you to determine the amount of access that your users have
in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com). Our Support teams review these
permissions to help determine user access when responding to support requests.

#### How do I manage permissions?

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions** in the
subnavigation bar.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** section and modify another userâ€™s
permission, you must have one of the following permissions:

  - **Account Administrator**: This permission grants a user unlimited access
    to every section of the MyRackspace portal.

  - **Admin**: This permission (on a device or service) grants a user the
    ability to manage the device or service, as well as which users can access the device or service.

For details about how to manage permissions, see [Manage user permissions for
Dedicated Hosting](/how-to/manage-user-permissions-for-dedicated-hosting).

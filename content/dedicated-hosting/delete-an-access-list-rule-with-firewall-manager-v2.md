Firewall Manager v2 is a tool within the MyRackspace portal that allows you to manage your Cisco firewall.

This article describes how to delete an access-list rule by using Firewall Manager v2.

To learn more about the tool, see [Firewall Manager v2](/how-to/firewall-manager-v2).

### Why use access-lists?

Access control lists (ACLs), or *access-lists*, enable Cisco firewalls to filter traffic. The security of your Rackspace environment begins at your Cisco firewall. Misconfigurations in network access policies on your firewall can lead to unwanted network exposure and potential compromise.

The access-lists control the traffic that attempts to enter the internal networks from an external, unsecured network. If access-lists are not used, the Cisco firewall's default security policy of _security-levels_ is active, which does not provide the highest level of network security.

An access control entry (ACE) is an individual entry in an ACL. ACEs are referred to as _rules_ in Firewall Manager v2. The Cisco firewall allows you to configure only one access-list per interface per direction. This access-list can contain as many ACEs, or rules, as necessary.

For more information about how to view, add, or modify access-lists, see the following articles:

    Firewall Manager v2 interacts with your firewall and deletes the configuration. This typically takes about 30 seconds, depending on the size of your firewall's configuration.

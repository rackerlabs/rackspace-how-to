### Scheduling a Net Device Reboot

On the **Schedule Reboot** page, fill in a **Reason** for your reboot. Next, select the **Date / Time** and select the Net Device(s) to be scheduled for a reboot. These are required fields to proceed. Once each of these variables are filled, the **Schedule Reboot** button will activate and allow you to press it.

After clicking the **Schedule Reboot** button, the next page displays a list of devices that will be impacted by the reboot. To proceed with scheduling the Net Device reboot, select **Confirm Reboot(s)**, and then select **OK** on the following warning confirmation screen.

After the confirmation button are clicked, you will receive a **Reboot(s) successfully scheduled** notification message at the top of the panel.

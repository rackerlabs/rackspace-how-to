The MyRackspace Portal now has a new Schedule Reboot option for Net Devices. This new tool will allow you to schedule a net device reboot for a predefined date and time. The Schedule Reboot tool will activate the reboot button process for your Net Device(s).

Details on the Reboot Button are located here: [https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/network-device-reboot-faq/](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/network-device-reboot-faq/)

### Scheduling a Net Device Reboot

Select the **_Products_** tab from the home page and then select **_Devices_**.


Next, on the **_Devices_** page, click the **_cog action icon_** to the left of the network device to be rebooted. Select the **_Schedule Reboot_** option.

On the **_Schedule Reboot_** page, fill in a **_Reason_** for your reboot. Next, select the **_Date / Time_** and select the Net Device(s) to be scheduled for a reboot. These are required fields to proceed. Once each of these variables are filled, the **_Schedule Reboot_** button will activate and allow you to press it.

After clicking the **_Schedule Reboot_** button, the next page displays a list of devices that will be impacted by the reboot. To proceed with scheduling the Net Device reboot, select **_Confirm Reboot(s)_**, and then select **_OK_** on the following warning confirmation screen.

After the confirmation button are clicked, you will receive a **_Reboot(s) successfully scheduled_** notification message at the top of the panel.

Select the **_Firewall / LB Reboots_** tab to see details on scheduled reboots. If required, select the **_Edit / Cancel_** options on the right to modify an entry.

### Editing a Scheduled Net Device Reboot

From the **_Firewall / LB Reboots_** tab select the **_Edit_** option to the right of the scheduled Net Device reboot entry. Select a new time and date on the window that comes up. Click **_Save_** and **_OK_** on the following windows to make the modification.

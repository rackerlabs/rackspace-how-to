You can log in to the Email Archive Manager directly from your
domain-specific URL (for example, `http://yourdomaincom.archivesrvr.com`).

Alternatively, you can log in through the Cloud Office Control Panel by
performing the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Office Control
    Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).

2.  Open the **Go to section** menu and select **Domains**.

3.  In the **Manage** section, click **Email Archiving**.

    **Note:**  If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate
    domain name. To change domains at any time, click the **Change
    domain** option at the top of the page.

4.  Click **Manage My Archive**.

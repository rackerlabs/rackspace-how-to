Before you cancel a Cloud Office account, you should plan how you will preserve your
archived email data. Archives typically export small numbers of archived items rather
than the entire archive. Therefore, you must plan before exporting an archive and set
aside an appropriate amount of time for completion.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Challenging 
- **Time needed:** Dependent on amount of data being exported
- **Tools required:**  Cloud Office Control Panel access and Archive Manager access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Before you export an archive

- Complete your archive export before setting a cancellation date for your Cloud Office account.
- Archive exports can take an extended period of time to complete. Be prepared for a completion time of several weeks to a few months.
- Decide whether to export in a **PST** or an **EML** format. Although **PST** is a more well-known format, exporting in **EML** is easier to search, faster to produce, and cheaper. 
- In most cases, more data means a longer and more expensive export if you request a bulk export from Support. If you want to export specific items, such as messages from a particular sender, or messages delivered within a specific time frame, exporting search results is a more efficient option. For information about how to export search results, see [Export archive search results in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

**Warning:** If you reach your cancellation date before completing the archive export, the export will be cancelled and you will be unable to retrieve the rest of your archive data.

### Export an archive

You can use the following methods to export your data from your Rackspace Archiving account:

#### Self exports

-   Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and
    exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to
    export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results
    in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

    **Note:** You can export searches with a maximum of 15,000 results or a total size of 3.5 GB

- To export an entire archive, divide your searches into monthly intervals for the duration of the archive's existence.
  
    **Note:** Searches do not build instantly. Be sure to consider this when determining your cancellation date.

#### Bulk exports

-   If you require a bulk export of your archived data, our support team can
    perform the export and provide you with links from which you can
    download your data directly.

- Bulk exports require an extended amount of time to complete. They can take several weeks to a few months to finish.

- You must contact Support directly to request a bulk archive export be scheduled

The pricing for a bulk export is a one-time fee and varies by amount of data as well as data format.

|Export Format| Price per Gigabyte(GB)|
|---|---|
|EML| $6 or &#65505;4 per GB|
|PST| $9 or &#65505;6 per GB|


**Note:** Support cannot to provide a quote for the price of requested bulk exports. This is because the total size of the export cannot be determined until it is completed and fully exported. The archive size displayed in your archive portal is the size of your article in compressed form. After your archive is decompressed, it is larger than the size displayed in the portal. The size displayed in the portal also doesnâ€™t include the size of attachments, which could increase the total size after decompression.

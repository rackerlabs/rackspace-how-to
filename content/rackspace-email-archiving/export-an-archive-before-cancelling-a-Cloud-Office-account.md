When considering cancellation of a Cloud Office account it is important to plan how you will preserve your archived email data. Archive's typically export small numbers of archived items rather than the entirety of an archive. Therefore, exporting an archive must be planned out and given a large amount of time for completion.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Challenging 
- **Time needed:** Dependent on amount of data being exported
- **Tools required:**  Cloud Office Control Panel access and Archive Manager access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Considerations for planning an archive export

- Complete your archive export before setting a cancellation date.
- Archive exports can take an extended period of time to complete. Timelines to completion can be several weeks to a few months.
- Decide whether to export in a PST or an EML format. Although PST is a more well-known format, exporting in EML tends to be easier to search, faster to produce, and cheaper. 
- In most cases, more data means a longer and more expensive export if requesting a bulk export from support. If you are looking to export specific items such as messages from a particular sender, or message delivered within a specific time frame, exporting search results is a more efficient option. For information about how to export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

**Warning:** If you reach your cancellation date before completing the archive export, the export will be cancelled and you will be unable to complete the export.

### Export Options

You can use the following methods to export your data from your Rackspace Archiving account:

#### Self Exports

-   Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and
    exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to
    export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results
    in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

    **Note:** You can export searches with a maximum of 15,000 results or a total size of 3.5 GB

- To export the entirety of the archive, divide your searches into monthly intervals for the entirety of the archive's existence.

- Searches do not build instantly. Be sure to consider this when determining your cancellation date.

#### Bulk Exports

-   If you require a bulk export of your archived data, our support team can
    perform the export and provide you with links from which you can
    download your data directly.

- Bulk exports require an extended amount of time to complete. They can take several weeks to a few months to finish.

- You must contact support directly to request a bulk archive export be scheduled

The pricing for a bulk export is a one-time fee and varies by amount of data as well as data format.

|Export Format| Price per Gigabyte(GB)|
|---|---|
|EML| $6 per GB|
|PST| $9 per GB|
|EML| &#65505;4 per GB|
|PST| &#65505;6 per GB|

**Note:** Support is unable to provide a quote for the price of requested bulk exports. This is because the total size of the export cannot be determined until it is completed and fully exported.

The number displaying total archive size in the archive portal is the size of your archive in compressed form. When it is exported and decompressed at a rate of about 1.8 on average, we find that the total size is bigger than what is seen in the Archive Portal. Additionally, the size in the Archive Portal doesn't include the size of attachments, which could increase the total size.

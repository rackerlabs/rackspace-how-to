**Note:** The information contained in this article is for Cloud Office
account administrators only.

Account administrators have the ability to create a login message for
their users to see when they log in to their Archive
at `https://domaincom.archivesrvr.com`. Use the following steps to
create a login message for Archive Manager users.

**Note:** Only one active message can be shown on the login screen at a
time.

1\. Log in to the [Archive
    Manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f).
    For more information, see [Log in to the Archive
    Manager](/how-to/log-in-to-the-archive-manager).

2\. In the upper-right corner of the window, click **Admin User** to
    access the Admin User dashboard.

**Note:** There are three dashboards for top-level administrators:
    **Search**, **Admin**, and **Admin User**.

3\. On the **Settings** tab, click **Login Messages**.

4\. On the right side of the window, click **New Message**.

5\. Enter the body of the message in the blank box next
    to **Message**.

6\. Click the calendar icon next to **Starts on** and select a start
    date.

**Note:** The dates are in military time format by default. This
    format can be modified.

7\. Click the calendar icon next to **Expires On** and select an end
    date.

8\. Click **Create**.

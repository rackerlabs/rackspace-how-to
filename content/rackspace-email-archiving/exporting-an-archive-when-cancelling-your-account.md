### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Difficult

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

When considering cancellation of your Cloud Office account it is important to plan out how you will preserve your archived email data. The functionality of an archive is typically to export small numbers of items rather than the entirety of the archive. For this reason, moving an entire archive is an undertaking that should be carefully planned out with plenty of time for completion.

### Considerations for Planning an Archive Export Prior to Cancellation

- Complete your archive export before setting a cancellation date.
- Archive exports can take an extended period of time to complete. Timelines to completion can be several weeks to a few months.
- To which format do you need to export?

    - We offer bulk exports in either PST or EML format. Although PST is a more well-known format, exporting in EML tends to be easier to search, faster for us to produce, and much cheaper. We recommend that you first determine whether there is a preferred format. If there is no preferred format, then we recommend using EML.

- Do you need to export all data or only data that meets certain criteria?

    - In most cases, more data means a longer and more expensive export if requesting a bulk export from support. If you are looking to export specific items such as messages from a particular sender, or message delivered within a specific time frame, exporting search results is a more efficient option. For information about how to export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

**Warning:** If you reach your cancellation date before completing the archive export, the export will be cancelled and you will be unable to complete the export.

### Export Options

You can use the following methods to export your data from your
Rackspace Archiving account:

#### Self Exports

-   Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and
    exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to
    export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results
    in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

    **Note:** You can export searches with a maximum of 15,000 results or a total size of 3.5 GB

- To export the entirety of the archive, you will want to divide your searches into month intervals for the entirety of the archive's existence.

- Searches do not build instantly. Be sure to consider this when determining your cancellation date.

#### Bulk Exports
-   If you require a bulk export of your archived data, our support team can
    perform the export and provide you with links from which you can
    download your data directly.

- Bulk exports require an extended amount of time to complete. They can take several weeks to a few months to finish.

- You must contact support directly to request a bulk archive export be scheduled

The pricing for a bulk export is a one-time fee and varies by amount of data as well as data format.

|Export Format| Price per Gigabyte(GB)|
|---|---|
|EML| $6 per GB|
|PST| $9 per GB|
|EML| &#65505;4 per GB|
|PST| &#65505;6 per GB|

**Note:** Support is unable to provide a quote for the price of requested bulk exports. This is because the total size of the export cannot be determined until it is completed and fully exported.

The number displaying total archive size in the archive portal is the size of your archive in compressed form. When it is exported and decompressed at a rate of about 1.8 on average, we find that the total size is bigger than what is seen in the Archive Portal. Additionally, the size in the Archive Portal doesn't include the size of attachments; so depending on how many attachments you have and how big they are, the total size would increase.

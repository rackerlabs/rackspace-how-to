The archiving feature of Rackspace Cloud Office collects and stores
external, internal, incoming, and outgoing email, including attachments.
This data can be accessed for search and review by the administrator of
the account and by administrator-designated users.

To enable archiving, [log in to the Cloud Office control
panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/), and perform the following steps:

1. In the **Go to section** menu at the top of the window, click
    **Domains**.

    <img src="{% asset_path rackspace-email-archiving/enable-email-archiving/Enable%20Archivinga_0.png %}" alt="EnableArchiving.png" />

2. In the **Manage** section, click **Email Archiving**.

    <img src="{% asset_path rackspace-email-archiving/enable-email-archiving/Enable%20Archiving%202a_0.png %}" alt="EnableArchiving2.png" />

3. If you have more more than one domain, select the domain for which
    you want to add archiving by clicking the domain's name in the list.
    The domain's name should appear at the top of the next page.

4. On the Email Archiving page, click **Add Archiving to this
    domain**.

    <img src="{% asset_path rackspace-email-archiving/enable-email-archiving/Enable%20Archiving%203a_0.png %}" alt="EnableArchiving3.png" />

5. Under **Domain settings,** select **On** for **Email Archiving**.

6. Click **Save**.

You will receive a welcome email with login information from
`mail@archivesrvr.com`. After you receive the welcome email, all new
email will be copied into the archive.

Messages will be indexed nightly for search purposes. To manually index
for immediate search access, click **Collect Now** in the **Collectors**
section of the Archive Manager.

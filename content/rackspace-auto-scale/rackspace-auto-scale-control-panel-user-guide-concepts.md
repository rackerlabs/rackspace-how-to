The [Introduction to Rackspace Auto Scale](/how-to/rackspace-auto-scale-control-panel-user-guide-introduction "Introduction")
article outlines what you can do with Auto Scale and what is required for its
setup. This section discusses what Auto Scale does and the core concepts
that drive it.

### Servers

A *server* is defined as a virtual machine (VM) instance in the
Rackspace Cloud Servers environment. To create a server, you must
specify a name, image reference, and flavor reference. Server images and
flavors are explained in this section.

Auto Scale works by creating servers that are based on server images
that you have predefined. So, before you can use Auto Scale, you must
have saved server images. If you create a server by using the **Cloud
Servers** tab in the Cloud Control Panel and save the image, the image
automatically appears in the **Auto Scale** tab.

### Server image

A *server image* is a copy of a server's disk. It contains the operating
system and all of the installed data and software on the server at the
time the image was taken. Multiple, identical servers can be created
from the same server image through the use of tools such as Auto Scale.

A server image can contain only a base operating system installation,
which you would use to create a new cloud server before installing
software on it, or it can contain all of the software necessary for a
server to start operating such as a web server set to respond to HTTP
requests. A server image does *not* include configuration details such
as IP address, server flavor, server networks, or mounted volumes. As a
result, a given server image can be applied to servers that have
different configurations than the master server from which the image was
generated, as long as the instance type has as much or more disk storage
as the original instance.

When you are configuring an image with software to use with Auto Scale,
be sure to use dynamic elements instead of static elements. All of the
files on cloned server images are identical, so if you are using
hard-coded machine IDs in configuration files on the master server
image, multiple systems will use the same machine ID. The server should
be set to use DHCP to obtain an IP address and other network parameters.
The Rackspace Cloud Monitoring agent is designed to behave correctly
when installed on server images that are using the same configuration
file.

Server images are available only in the region in which they were
generated. Server images can be created so that they update themselves
at startup with the newest version of software. Or you can create a new
image and edit the scaling group to incorporate new software versions.

### Server flavor

The *server flavor* is the amount of CPU, RAM, system disk, networks
(the aggregate outbound bandwidth across all attached networks), and
disk I/O that you assign when you configure a server. For example, the
**512MB Standard Instance** server flavor corresponds to 1 vCPU, 512 MB
RAM, 20 GB system disk, 80 Mb/s network, and Good disk I/O.

### Server networks

The *server networks* that you choose are all of the networks on which
your service operates.

### Scaling groups

A *scaling group* is a set of identical servers and, optionally, a load
balancer, defined by the launch configuration that you set. The group
can scale up and down in response to load, as defined by the scaling
policy that you configure and bound by your scaling group configuration.

### Cooldowns

*Cooldowns* enforce a period of time between possible actions. Auto
Scale has the following types of cooldowns:

-   *Minimum (group) Cooldown*: Use to enforce a minimum amount of time
    for your servers to scale up. The complexity of the servers that you
    are adding, not the number of servers, determines how much time they
    need to fully deploy. A 10-minute minimum cooldown is sufficient for
    most server images.
-   *Policy Cooldown*: Use to prevent a policy from being triggered
    too soon. For scale-up policies, a longer policy cooldown is usually
    acceptable, whereas you might want a short policy cooldown for
    scale-down policies, ensuring a gradual removal of servers.

**Note**: Cooldowns are mainly relevant to event-based scaling policies
because those policies are triggered by events that could occur before a
required cooldown period. Schedule-based policies that conflict with a
cooldown period are not executed.

The following graph illustrates how cooldowns affect policy execution.

## Scaling policies

The *scaling policy*<span style="line-height: 1.6;"> determines what kind of scaling occurs&mdash;up or down&mdash;and when scaling occurs. You must define separate polices for scaling up and scaling down. You can have multiple scaling policies per scaling group.

For schedule-based policies, you can use a cron job to configure the
schedule. At the specified time, Auto Scale adds servers or removes them
as dictated by the policy.

You can also configure the scale-up and scale-down to be a set number,
or a percentage of your total scaling group.

And, you can use a webhook to respond to an event and trigger a policy.
You can create the policy with the webhook by using the control panel,
but you have to use the Auto Scale API to create and configure the
webhook. You can learn more about webhooks in the *Auto Scale API
Developers Guide* section on
[Webhooks](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#webhooks-and-capability-urls).

The following diagrams illustrate some of the principles governing
scaling policies.

### Scale up by percentage policy

The following diagram illustrates how a percentage scale-up policy
translates into a different amount of scaling each time that it is
invoked and changes the total number of servers.

### Scale by schedule policy

The following diagram illustrates how a scheduled scale-up policy can be
configured to respond to anticipated increases in traffic.

### Scaling policies restricted by minimum and maximum values

The following diagram illustrates how the configured minimum and maximum
number of servers in the scaling group restricts scale-ups and
scale-downs.

###  Delete servers policy

The following diagram illustrates how a scale-down policy operates first
on pending servers (servers in the process of being added) and then on
the oldest servers in the scaling group.

### Load balancers

A properly configured *load balancer* automatically distributes traffic
to the least-loaded servers. The load balancer configuration in your
scaling group is optional. If you do configure a load balancer, choose
from the load balancers that you have added to your cloud server
account. The load balancer sends traffic to your cloud servers on the
node port that you configure.

### Getting started

### Is there an easy path to migrate from other autoscaling products such as Rightscale?

No. Your configurations cannot be migrated from other providers.

### Is authentication required for Auto Scale?

Authentication is required to create a scaling group; you must send
an **X-Auth-Token** header with most API requests. Authentication is not
required to execute policies via anonymous webhooks.

### What do I need to do to get started using Auto Scale?

Auto Scale works by horizontally scaling a particular tier of an
application; for example, the web tier. You need to know which servers
you want to scale. To get started, you need a server image that you have
configured with all needed applications and settings, and that is
configured to be ready when the server is started. You can ensure your
servers deploy fully ready for service by using various programs such as
Chef, Puppet, and Salt.

### Does Auto Scale record the history of a scale action?

Not currently. The **history** resource on the Auto Scale API endpoint
will show scaling history, triggers, and user changes. It will be
available in a future release.

### How do I know what actions are taken by Auto Scale on my behalf?

Some of the actions Auto Scale takes on your behalf are deferred; for
example, when you set a schedule to create additional servers. Auto
Scale will soon have an advanced audit log to track when Rackspace takes
actions on your behalf. You will be able to access this through
the **history** resource on the Auto Scale API endpoint.

### How much does the Rackspace Auto Scale service cost?

Auto Scale is available at no cost to Rackspace Cloud customers,
although you do pay for the servers created by a scale-up until they are
removed.

### Can I add an existing server to an Auto Scale group?

No. Even if you add the **autoscale-group-id** metadata to the server,
the Auto Scale back end service will not know the server belongs in the
group. Auto Scale manages only servers created by Auto Scale.

### What happens if I delete an Auto Scale server through the API or the Cloud Control Panel?

Auto Scale currently does not track what happens to servers outside of
the Auto Scale system. If a server is deleted outside of the system,
Auto Scale will continue to treat the server as if it still exists. If
you then try to delete the server through Auto Scale (for example, by
scaling down), no problems should occur.

A new API endpoint has been added to Auto Scale, **DELETE server**, that
allows you to remove a specific server from a scaling group. You can use
this endpoint to bring Auto Scale back in sync with the correct number
of servers in a group when a server has been deleted through the API or
the Cloud Control Panel. For more information, see the Rackspace Auto
Scale Developer's Guide [Delete server from scaling
group](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#delete-server-from-scaling-group)
section.

### Can I suspend servers and restore them quickly to the same IP address?

You can remove a server from an Auto Scale group and keep it on your
Cloud account for observation. Auto Scale will automatically replace it
with a new server.

Newly created servers have different IP addresses unless they arecreated in a scaling group with a load balancer.


### Why might I see a server get created and then immediately destroyed?

A server may be created for a scale-up operation and then be immediately
deleted if there is a problem with the load balancer associated with the
scaling group. The load balancer problems that can cause this are:

-   The load balancer is mis-configured
-   The load balancer is at its limit
-   The load balancer has been deleted

If any of these problems are present, Auto Scale immediate deletes the
newly-created server so the customer doesn't get billed for servers not
in the load balancers.

### I got a 403 "Cannot execute policy - no change in servers" error when I tried to execute the policy. What does this mean?

One possibility is that you tried to scale up or down beyond the
configured minimum or maximum value. As a result, no servers could be
created or destroyed. The error message could also mean that you are
trying to set the needed capacity equal to what Auto Scale thinks is
already there.

### Does Auto Scale drain connections on a node behind a load balancer as a server (LBaaS) before removing it from a pool?

No. The server is removed from the load balancer before the delete
command is sent. At present, connections are not drained.

### What is the maximum amount of time you can set for a cooldown timer?

The maximum is 86400 seconds, equal to 24 hours.

### What is the minimum amount of time you can set for a cooldown time?

Zero seconds. We recommend having the group cooldown being around 5
minutes (300 seconds) by default.

### How does Auto Scale moderate conflicting events?

Cooldown timers are built in to the scaling group and the individual
scaling policies, so that you can prevent too many servers from being
created or deleted too quickly.

### Multiple scaling policies can be associated with the same scaling group. How is the "correct" policy selected when servers are generated?

Scheduled policies are triggered at the time they are scheduled. Other
policies are triggered by a webhook and the name or "handle" for each
policy is defined by a construct called a webhook, which is a unique URL
endpoing you call to invoke the policy execution.

### What are the different configuration parameters for scaling groups?

For information on the parameters used with the Auto Scale API, see the
[Scaling group
configurations](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/autoscale-groups)
and [Launch
configuration](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/autoscale/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/configurations)
sections in the Auto Scale API Developer's Guide.

For information on the parameters used with the Auto Scale Control
Panel, see the [Create a scaling
group](/how-to/rackspace-auto-scale-control-panel-user-guide-create-a-scaling-group)
section in the Rackspace Auto Scale Control Panel User Guide.

### Are monitoring rules for the entire scaling group or can I monitor specific servers in the scaling group?

No. There are no specific rules within Auto Scale for monitoring
specific servers. However, you can do this through Monitoring
configurations, which are documented in the [Cloud Monitoring API
Developer's
Guide](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/).

### Can I have multiple load balancers in a scaling group?

Yes. However, if you need to scale beyond 25 servers with a Cloud Load
Balancer, we recommend creating multiple Auto Scale groups and creating
a tree of load balancers.

### Is there a limit to the number of servers I can have in a scaling group?

There is no maximum number of servers in a scaling group. However, a
scaling group used with a Cloud Load Balancer instance is limited to 50
servers per load balancer group and you may have overall Cloud Servers
limits on the number of servers you are allowed to create without having
your quota bumped up. If you reach Cloud Load Balancer limits, Auto
Scale will fail to add additional servers. If you are running up against
limits with Cloud Load Balancer instances, you should consider creating
multiple scaling groups and a tree of load balancers to service requests
or using RackConnect to use a higher capacity hardware load balancer
solution. For more information on RackConnect, see [How do I get started
with
RackConnect?](/how-to/rackconnect-v20)

### Do the servers that I'm going to automatically scale up have to be associated with a group? If so, why?

Yes. A scaling policy is associated with a specific group. All of the
scaled-up servers are managed for health and monitoring in aggregate so
they need to be part of a group.

### Can I create a scaling group with no servers in it?

Yes. You can add servers later.

### What is a scaling group?

A scaling group is a construct that contains the configuration for
creating individual servers, has zero or more servers associated with
it, and has one or more associated scaling policies that describe what
actions to take when the policy is activated.

### Can I scale up servers in a particular order? For example, can I create a database server before creating a web server?

No. Auto Scale does not scale up servers or load balancers in a
particular order.

### Is it possible for Auto Scale to create servers that are not attached to a load balancer?

Yes. A load balancer is not required as part of the launch
configuration. however, you do need to configure how your servers get
requests.

### Can Auto Scale add a server in ORD to a load balancer in the DFW data center, or use an image in DFW?

No, all resources must be in the same data center. There is a different
Auto Scale endpoint for each data center, and each endpoint orchestrates
only within that data center. In the Auto Scale control panel, data
centers are called **Regions**.

### Can I use Auto Scale across data centers?

No, you must create separate scaling groups for different data centers.

### How does Auto Scale integrate with image services or other automation services, such as Chef or Puppet?

Auto Scale is service agnostic and API based, so it works well with
these services but does not explicitly integrate with them.

1. [Create an account](#create-an-account)

3. [Build your cloud](#build-your-cloud)
4. [Grow your cloud](#grow-your-cloud)

#### Create an account

Whether you are designing, testing, or are ready to launch your application in to production, you need a home for your code. Before accomplishing any of that, you must first create your account.

#### Manage and secure an account

Now that you have created an account there are a few things you should do to prevent surprises.

1. Protect your account by enabling [Multi-factor authentication](/how-to/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel/). Multi-factor authentication is a free tool that can greatly decrease the chances of your account being compromised.

2. Public Cloud is billed on an hourly basis, and resources such as file storage and traffic can have varying costs. For this reason, you should [create a billing threshold notification](/how-to/billing-services-overview/#set-a-billing-threshold/) that alerts you to unexpected billing changes.

3. Learn how to add users, create user groups, set up role based access, view your bill, or change payment methods and account information by reviewing our comprehensive [Account management](/how-to/account-management/) article.

#### Build your cloud

Your account is now ready for you to build devices. Building a cloud environment is quite different from traditional hosting. We have compiled the following documents to illustrate those differences as well as to help you navigate them:

- [Building your application on the Rackspace cloud](/how-to/build-your-application-on-the-rackspace-cloud/)
- [Rackspace open cloud architecture](/how-to/rackspace-open-cloud-reference-architecture/)
- [About cloud servers](/how-to/cloud-servers/)
- [About cloud load balancers](/how-to/cloud-load-balancers/)

#### Grow your cloud

Your business is booming, and you need to grow! Perhaps it is an event, seasonal traffic plans, or your needs have simply changed. When you experience growth, you can become less fault tolerant and have more security needs. Check out the following information to ensure that you sustain momentum:

- [Scale for high traffic events](/how-to/prepare-for-high-traffic-events/)
- [Protect your cloud infrastructure with firewall hardware](/how-to/rackconnect/)

You can use Rackspace Intelligence to help you observe the status of
your server if you set up the server to be visible to Rackspace
Intelligence. You can do this through the [Cloud Control
Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) by following these steps:

1.  Log in to the Cloud Control Panel. If you are in the Rackspace
    Intelligence interface, you can open the control panel by clicking
    the **Rackspace Intelligence** menu at the top of the interface and
    selecting **Rackspace Cloud**.
2.  Create a server as you normally would, or select an existing server.
    For instructions on creating a server, see
    [Create a Cloud Server](/how-to/create-a-cloud-server).
3.  List the server's details by selecting **Servers &gt; Cloud
    Servers** and then clicking the server's name.

4.  On the server details page, scroll down to the **Monitoring
    Data** section and click the **View Server's Metrics in Rackspace
    Intelligence** link.
5.  Install the monitoring agent on the server by clicking **Get
    Started**.

6.  On the **Monitoring Agent Installation** page, choose the platform
    installed on your server and choose the type of installation
    instructions that you prefer. 

    **Note:** The Monitoring Agent can be automatically installed when
    creating a new cloud server. After choosing your server image and flavor, 
    select **Monitor recommended server metrics** under Recommended Installs.
    
    The following example shows the **Step By Step** instructions for a Linux platform. Follow the instructions
    to install, configure, and start the agent.

    The instructions require you to send commands to the server. The
    commands you must send to the server vary depending on what kind of
    server you want to monitor. Similarly, detailed procedures for
    sending commands to a server vary depending on what kind of
    workstation you use when you communicate with the server. For
    example, [Connecting to Linux from Mac OS X by using
    Terminal](/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-mac-os-x-by-using-terminal) shows
    how to install and use the Terminal utility on a Mac OS X
    workstation communicating with a Linux server; if you are working in
    a different configuration, adapt these instructions to match your
    environment

    **Note:**
    No matter what kind of server you want to monitor, you
    must know the server's IP address and password before you can log in
    and begin installing the monitoring agent there. The server's IP
    address is provided when you use the Cloud Control Panel to list
    details about the server. If you do not know the server's password
    but you are able to log in to the Cloud Control Panel for your
    account, you can change the server's password as described at [How
    to change your server root/admin password from your
    account](/how-to/how-to-change-your-server-rootadmin-password-from-your-account).

    In the terminal session where you entered the installation commands,
    you can confirm that the installation succeeded if you see the
    message Your Agent configuration is now complete. After this, with
    the agent running, if you look again at the **Monitoring Agent
    Installation** page you can see that the agent connection status
    is **Connected**.

7.  Click **Setup Checks** to configure at least one check. In the
    following example, two CPU-related checks are configured, monitoring
    CPU usage and average CPU load.

8.  Click **Apply Checks** to activate the checks that you defined. When
    the checks are activated, their status is reported on the entities
    details page for the server, in the **Monitoring Checks** section.

9.  To make the checks useful, define alarms that identify boundaries
    between OK, Warning, and Critical statuses. For instructions,
    see [Working with alarms](/how-to/working-with-alarms).

To use Rackspace Intelligence, you must have a dedicated Rackspace
customer account and you must be logged in to the
[MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com) portal for that account.
Rackspace Intelligence has no separate login process.

To access Rackspace Intelligence:

1.  Go to [MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com) and log in to the portal by
    providing your **Rackspace Account Number**, **Username** and
    **Password**.

2.  On the [MyRackspace Customer Portal](https://my.rackspace.com), click **Services** and then
    select **Availability Monitoring** from the list.

    This takes you to the **Entities** page, which lists all of your
    available entities. From this page, you can explore all the details
    for the entities that have been configured for you.

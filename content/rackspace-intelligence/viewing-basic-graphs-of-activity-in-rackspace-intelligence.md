Rackspace Intelligence provides a set of predefined graphs that
represent the activity of any metrics and checks that have been defined
for your monitoring entities. Rackspace Intelligence now displays
out-of-the-box graphs for all of your checks.

If you want to explore a metric across multiple entities, consider using
custom graphs. For more information, read [Creating custom graphs of
activity in Rackspace
Intelligence](/how-to/creating-custom-graphs-of-activity-in-rackspace-intelligence).

### View default graphs

To view the default graphs that are available for you, click
**Visualize** at the top of the interface, and then click **Basic
Graphs**.

To view any of the default graphs for your entities**,** click
**Rackspace Default** under **Graph Collections**.

To view a graph for a specific check, in the **Graphs by Check**
section, click the name of the check for which you want to see the
graphs, such as **CPU**.

A list of graphs are displayed that are available for your check.

filter for your favorites.

To mark a graph as favorite, click the favorite icon to the left of the
title of the graph.

Collections.**

### Specify a time range

Rackspace Intelligence lets you use preset or custom time ranges for the
data that is collected and displayed in graphs.

If you choose a preset time range, Rackspace Intelligence shows data
collected for the entity during the most recent period of that range:

-   One hour
-   Eight hours
-   One day
-   One week
-   One month

If you choose a custom time range and click **Apply**, Rackspace
Intelligence shows data collected for the entity between the first and
last time stamp.

### Adjust the layout of your graph page

You can adjust the way your graphs are displayed on the page by
selecting the appropriate display icon on the top right corner of the
page.

You can choose from one of the two display options:

-   *grid layout* - displays two graphs side by side
-   *linear layout* - displays your graphs in linear sequence

The following example shows a grid layout:

**Note:** This guide is for Rackspace Intelligence on a dedicated
account. If you have a standard cloud account, click
[here](/how-to/getting-started-with-rackspace-intelligence-for-the-cloud)
for the applicable getting started guide.

Rackspace Intelligence now supports dedicated customer accounts.
Dedicated customers can use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to view
their availability monitors.

Rackspace Intelligence provides a data panel, called a *dashboard*, that
shows actionable insights into infrastructure health.

As a customer with a dedicated account:

-   Use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to view the availability of
    your applications.
-   Create customized visualizations and graphs.
-   Use remote checks of type
    [ping](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-ping), [tcp](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-tcp),
    and
    [http](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-http).
    For more information, see [Remote check
    types](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-check-types).

**Note**: Rackspace customers who have dedicated devices that are still
using the Sitescope monitoring system will not be able to access
Rackspace Intelligence until after all devices have been upgraded to
Rackspace Monitoring. The effort to upgrade devices from Sitescope to
Rackspace Monitoring starts on October 15, 2015 and is expected to be
completed before the end of the 2015.

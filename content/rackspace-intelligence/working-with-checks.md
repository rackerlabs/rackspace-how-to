Rackspace Intelligence provides an interface that you can use to create
new checks to generate metrics for your entities, and to update existing
checks.

Each check has a designated *type*. The check type instructs the
monitoring system how to check the monitored resource. For more
information, see [Check
types](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#check-types).

Check types are divided into two categories: agent checks and remote checks.

### Agent checks

Checks are of the *agent* type if they monitor an entity's resource utilization.
Agent-type
checks are performed by the monitoring agent running on a server.
For example, a **Memory** check can trigger an alarm if it detects
memory usage above a specified percentage. Agent checks require the
monitoring agent to be installed on the server. For a list of
available agent check types, see
[Agent check types](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#agent-check-types).
For information on how to install the monitoring agent, see [Install and configure](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-install-configure).

Rackspace Intelligence supports the following types of agent checks:

- Apache
- CPU
- Custom Plugin
- Disk
- Filesystem
- Load Average
- Memory
- SQL Plan Cache
- SQL Memory Manager
- SQL Buffer Manager
- SQL Version
- SQL Statistics
- MySQL
- Network
- Redis
- Windows PerfOS

### Remote checks

Checks are of the **remote** type if they monitor an entity's internet connectivity. Remote-type
checks are performed by attempting to contact the entity from
outside the entity.
For example, a **Ping** check can trigger an alarm if it detects packet
loss above a specified percentage. For a list of available remote
checks, see
[Remote check types](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#remote-check-type-ref).
For information on how to install the monitoring agent, see [Install and configure](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-install-configure).

Rackspace Intelligence supports the following types of remote checks:

- DNS
- FTP Banner  
- HTTP
- IMAP Banner
- Ping
- POP3 Banner
- SMTP Banner
- SMTP
- SSH
- TCP
- Telnet Banner

### Checks available through CLI or API

Some checks that cannot be created with the Rackspace Intelligence
interface can be created by using the Cloud Monitoring CLI or API. These
checks are listed at
[Rackspace Cloud Monitoring Checks and Alarms](/how-to/rackspace-monitoring-checks-and-alarms).

### Checks and alerts

Checks can generate alerts. You can observe open alerts within the
Rackspace Intelligence dashboard, as explained at
[Monitoring open alerts with Rackspace Intelligence](/how-to/monitoring-open-alerts-with-rackspace-intelligence).
You can also choose to notify someone
(for example, on-call technical support) or to suppress notification
(for example, during scheduled maintenance).

### Create a check

To create a new check, complete the following steps:

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Intelligence
    interface](http://intelligence.rackspace.com).
2.  On the **Monitoring** page, click the entity for which you want to
    create the check.
3.  In the **Monitoring Checks** section of the entity details page,
    click **Create Check**.

    displays a details page with the name of your check. This page

3.  Click **Save Status**.

#### Modify the parameters of a check

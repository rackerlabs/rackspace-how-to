Rackspace Intelligence monitors the availability of your IT
infrastructure and, when limits are exceeded, can respond by notifying
someone.

When you [log in to Rackspace Intelligence](/how-to/log-in-to-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts)[,](/how-to/log-in-to-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts)
you can view all your relevant information on the dashboard:

The dashboard provides a main overview of all of your monitoring
activities.

You can also examine different aspects of how Rackspace Intelligence is
configured to monitor your system by accessing the following sections
from the header:

- **Monitor**
- **Notify**
- **Visualize**

Within each section, you can refine your focus by choosing from the
offerings in that section. For example, in the **Monitor** section, you can
choose to work with entities or open alerts.

Customers with dedicated accounts can use Rackspace Intelligence
to view information about the following items:

- Entities monitored by Rackspace Intelligence
- Open alerts
- Checks
- Notifications
- Notification plans

You can also use the Rackspace Intelligence dashboard to [view and
generate graphs to visualize infrastructure
availability](/how-to/viewing-and-creating-graphs-of-activity-in-rackspace-intelligence-for-dedicated-accounts).

**Note** Customers with dedicated accounts cannot use Rackspace
Intelligence to create or edit entities, alarms, checks, notifications,
and notification plans.

Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware (RPC-VMware) allows IT organizations to benefit
from the capabilities of a VMware based private cloud, without having to invest
time, energy, and resources building and managing the ongoing operations of running
and optimizing VMware software and the underlying physical infrastructure that powers
it. 

RPC-VMware is built on VMware Cloud Foundation validated designs, allowing for
predictable low-risk deployments, continuous updates for the most up-to-date VMware
capabilities, as well as improved lifecycle management of VMware components.

This list of frequently asked questions provides details about RPC-VMware features and
management options.

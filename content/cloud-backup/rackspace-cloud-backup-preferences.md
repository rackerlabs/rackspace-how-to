**Previous section:** [Cloud Backup System Actions](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-system-actions)

When you created your backups, you determined how Cloud Backup would
inform you about that single backup's activity. On the Preferences page,
you determine how you get emailed about all the activity on your
account: Daily, Weekly, or Both.

1.  Select frequency of emails:

    -   **Weekly Notifications** - Check the box next to send a weekly
        summary by email of all backups and restores.
    -   **Daily Notifications** - Check the box next to send a daily
        summary by email of all backups and restores.

2.  Enter your email address.

3.  Click the **Save Preferences** button.

You may cancel your Daily or Weekly emails by unchecking the respective boxes and click **Save Preferences** button.

The following steps are required to configure Microsoft Exchange 2007
ActiveSync on a Blackberry 10 Phone:

**Note:** A BES data plan must be purchased through your provider and
added to your account; your administrator will then purchase a [BES
license](/how-to/add-an-activesync-or-bes-license),  
assign it to your email address, and provide you with an activation PIN.

1. Log into your User Control
   Panel at the following URL: <https://admin.emailsrvr.com/usercp>

2. Scroll down to the **Client Setup** section and
   click on the **ActiveSync** link. This will open the **Setting Up ActiveSync**
   window which will contain the information needed to set up your
   device.

3. Locate the **Settings** options from within your home menu.

   is in the **Setting up ActiveSync** window. Then enter your mailbox
   password.

    inbox.

Support coverage for Rackspace Dedicated VMware vCloud is similar to that of our other server virtualization products. Our virtualization team maintains configurations and services in order to ensure server uptime.

With Dedicated vCloud, you can designate the service level for virtual machines (VMs) as managed or unmanaged. Both service levels include Rackspace support for the host infrastructure and virtualization software. Managed VMs include additional support for the guest operating system running on the VM.

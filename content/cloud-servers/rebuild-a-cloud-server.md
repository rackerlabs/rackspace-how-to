**Note**:  Rebuilding your server from an image is not an option
currently available for OnMetal servers.

### Previous section

[Create a Cloud Server](/how-to/create-a-cloud-server)

One advantage of rebuilding your server (versus creating a new server)
is that you retain the same IP address, which saves you from having to
update your DNS records and wait for DNS propagation.

**Note**: Rebuilding an image destroys all of the data on the server. Be
sure to back up any data you wish to keep in a safe location prior to
performing this task.

1.  From the Cloud Servers page, click the **Actions** menu next to the
    server name.
2.  Choose **Rebuild from Image**.

3.  Select a Rackspace image or one of your own previously saved images
    from the Saved tab, then click **Rebuild Server**.

4.  A pop-up screen appears with the new root password. Save this
    password as you won't be able to see it again once you dismiss
    the message.

The server's status changes to *Rebuilding*. When the build is complete,
the status changes back to *Active*.

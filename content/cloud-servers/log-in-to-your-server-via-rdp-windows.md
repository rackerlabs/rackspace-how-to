This article addresses how to connect and log in to your Windows Server
using Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol.

### Windows and Mac Versions

The screenshots below show how to use RDP via Windows XP. Different
versions of Windows such Windows 7 and Windows 8 will vary slightly,
however the operation of Remote Desktop remains the same across all
versions of Windows.

On a Mac, download and install the Remote Desktop Connection Client for
Mac. The steps to connect to your server are very similar. You can
download the software
[here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12).

Connection for Mac please see this

Rackspace Public Cloud provides the following supported images. 
Services are updated to support the latest version of an OS on the same date that
the OS is updated. Earlier versions of an OS are supported only for a
limited amount of time after the OS is updated.

We support the most current versions of the following OSs:

-   CentOS
-   CoreOS*
-   Debian
-   Fedora*
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (OnMetal Servers only)
-   Ubuntu
-   Vyatta
-   Windows Server 2008 R2
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2016 (OnMetal Servers only)

Any OS that is marked as EOL (end-of-life) by its distributor is not supported by Rackspace.

*Not supported at the Managed Operations Service level

All Next Generation Cloud Servers automatically receive three static IP
addresses upon creation:

-   A version 4 **IP Address** that provides public access to your
    server from the Internet.
-   A version 6 **IP Address** that provides public access to your
    server from the Internet.
-   A ServiceNet IP address that you lets you access the server from
    other Cloud Servers or Cloud Load Balancers in the same region over
    the Rackspace datacenter network. Read more about
    [Regions](/how-to/about-regions).

To locate the IP addresses for your Cloud Server:

1.  Log in to your [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).
2.  On the Cloud Servers page, click the name of server.
3.  Scroll down to the Networks table.

Following is a sample Networks table:

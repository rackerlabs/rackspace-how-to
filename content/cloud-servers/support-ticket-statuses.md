After you create a support ticket, it can have one of the following statuses, depending on the work done on it:

-   **New**
-   **Feedback Received**
-   **In Progress**
-   **Pending Customer**
-   **Pending Vendor**
-   **Pending Maintenance**
-   **Transferred**
-   **Solved**
-   **Closed**

The following process explains how a ticket moves through these
statuses:

1.  As soon as a Rackspace Cloud customer opens a ticket, it has a status of **New**.
    
2.  When a ticket has been placed in the Rackspace Cloud support team's queue, it has a status of **Feedback Received**.

3.  After a ticket is reviewed by the Rackspace Cloud support team, it moves to the **In Progress** status.
    
4.  If the support team needs more information from the customer to fix the issue, the ticket might move to the **Pending Customer** status.
    
5.  If the ticket is waiting for an update or release from a vendor, the ticket might move to the **Pending Vendor** status.

6.  If the ticket is waiting for a maintenance window and is not being actively worked, the ticket might move to the **Pending Maintenance** status.

7.  If a ticket moves to another member of the support team, it has a status of **Transferred**.

8. When Rackspace solves the issue, the status is changed to **Solved**.

9.  After a ticket has a status of **Solved**, a customer can move the ticket to **Closed** or reopen it, which changes the status to **In Progress**.

10.  If a customer does not explicitly close or reopen a ticket with a **Solved** status, the ticket automatically goes to the **Closed** status after a set period of time, depending on the nature of the ticket's request.

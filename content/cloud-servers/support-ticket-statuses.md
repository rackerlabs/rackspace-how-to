To see how to create a Rackspace support ticket, see [Getting Fanatical
Support -
Tickets](/how-to/getting-fanatical-support-6-tickets).

After you create a support ticket, it can have one of the following
statuses, depending on the work done on it:

-   **New**
-   **Feedback Received**
-   **In Progress**
-   **Pending Customer**
-   **Pending Vendor**
-   **Pending Maintenance**
-   **Transferred**
-   **Solved**
-   **Closed**

The following process explains how a ticket moves through these
statuses:

1.  As soon as a Rackspace Cloud customer opens a ticket, it has a
    status of **New**.
2.  When a ticket has been seen by a member of Rackspace Cloud support
    team, it has a status of **Feedback Received.**
3.  After a ticket is reviewed by the Rackspace Cloud support team, it
    moves to the **In Progress** or **Solved** status.
4.  If the support team needs more information from the customer to fix
    the issue, the ticket might move to the **Pending Customer** status.
5.  If the ticket is pending an update or release from a vendor, the
    ticket might move to the **Pending Vendor** status.
6.  If the ticket is pending a maintenance window and is not being
    actively worked, the ticket might move to the **Pending
    Maintenance** status.
7.  If a ticket moves to another member of the support team, it has a
    status of **Transferred**.
8.  After a ticket has a status of **Solved**, a customer can move the
    ticket to **Closed** or reopen it, which changes the status to **In
    Progress**.
9.  If a customer does not explicitly close or reopen a ticket with a
    **Solved** status, the ticket automatically goes to the **Closed**
    status in seven days.

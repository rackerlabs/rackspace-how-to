An extremely important aspect of managing your server is controlling the
(Linux) **root** or (Windows) **Administrator** account password. You
can always reset it through the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

### Reset your server password

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**.

3. Select **Servers > Cloud Servers**.

4. Click the gear icon next to the server for which you want to
change the password.

5. Under "Manage", click **Change Password**.

6. Enter the new password and click **Save Password**.

After you enter the new password, your server reboot and the new
password is set.

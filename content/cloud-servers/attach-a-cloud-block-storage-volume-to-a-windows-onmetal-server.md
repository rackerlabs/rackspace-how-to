If you need more than 32 GB of storage but do not have a requirement for
the fast I/O normally provided by an OnMetal server, you  can connect an
OnMetal server to a Cloud Block Storage (CBS) volume. Using an OnMetal
server with CBS is particularly useful for OnMetal Compute and Memory v1
flavors.

If you don't already have a CBS volume, use the following procedure to create
a new a  volume by using the Cloud Control Panel.

### Create a new CBS volume

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. Under the Storage tab, choose *Block Storage Volumes*.

3. Click *Create Volume*, and fill in the fields.

4. Click *Create Volume* again.

Use the following procedure to attach a CBS volume to your OnMetal server by
using the Cloud Control Panel. The procedure assumes that the server instance
already exists.

### Attach an existing CBS volume to a server

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. Under the Storage tab, choose *Block Storage Volumes*.

3. Click the cog beside the volume that you want to attach, and select *Attach
   Volume*.

4. Select a server from the list, and click *Attach Volume*.

   **Note:** You can attach more than one volume to a server.

   Result: a window pops up with the following information:

       # set initiator name
       echo InitiatorName=iqn.2008-10.org.openstack: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a > /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
       # discover targets for a given portal
       iscsiadm -m discovery --type sendtargets --portal 10.190.142.197:3260
       # connect to the target
       iscsiadm -m node --targetname=iqn.2010-11.com.rackspace: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a --portal 10.190.142.197:3260 â€“login

   From this output, take note of two `node` values that are needed to connect
   your CBS volume to your Windows OnMetal server: The `targetname` iqn, which
   is the initiator and the target for your volume, and the `portal` IP address
   and port, which are your address. In the preceding example, these values are:


       Target = iqn.2010-11.com.rackspace: ae9f0492-d19d-45d3-9eac-6987b07f145a
       Address = 10.190.142.197:3260


### Connect the volume in Windows

With the preceding information noted, perform the following steps.

1. Log in to the Windows instance as a user with Administrator privileges, and
   open the Services Management console.

2. Select the *Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service* > *Properties*.

3. Set the service to start automatically, and then start the service.

4. Next, open the Administrator control panel by selecting *Start* ->
   *Control Panel* -> *Administrator Tools*.

5. Open the iSCSI initiator.  Click on the second tab, *Discovery*, and then
   click *Discover Portal*.

   Result: A window pops up where you can enter the CBS storage node address.

6. Enter the IP address (the `portal` IP address and port, which you noted
   earlier),and click *OK*.

   Result: the target server appears in the list on the Discovery page.

7. Click the *Targets* page, and enter the target ICQ (the `targetname`, which
   you noted earlier).

8. On the *target* line, and enter the target IQN (the `targetname`, which
   you noted earlier), starting with "iqn". Then click *Quick Connect*.

9. Open the Administrator control panel by selecting *Start* -> *Control Panel*
   -> *Administrator Tools*, and click *Computer Management*.

10. Select *Storage* -> *Disk Management* to see all of your drives.

    Result: Because the CBS volume is attached, a second disk, the target, is
    listed and can then be prepared and brought online.

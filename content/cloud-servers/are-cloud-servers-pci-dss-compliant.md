Rackspace data centers are Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security
Standard (DSS) compliant and Safe Harbor compliant in addition to having
SSAE16 Type II, SOC1, SOC2 (Security and Availability Only), and SOC3
audits on file for all data center facilities.

As a Rackspace Cloud customer, we can help you become PCI compliant,
however it will take some work on your end. To read more about the
requirements for PCI compliance and how Rackspce can help, see [PCI

If the demands being placed on a [running program](/how-to/checking-running-services-on-linux)
cause it to request excessive resources from your server this can lead
to poor performance and system instability.

### Uptime

First let's check the load on your server using the `uptime` command.

    $ uptime
    15:16:45 up 41 days,  2:35,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 3.01, 2.70

The example shows the output from `uptime`. When the command was run at
15:16:45, the server had been up for 41 days 2 hours and 35 minutes,
there were two users logged on and the load averages were 0.01, 3.01 and
2.70.

The load average represents the work being done by the system. The
three numbers show the load averages for the last minute, 5 minutes and
15 minutes, respectively. A load average of 1 reflects the
full workload of a single processor on the system. A load
of 2 on a system with two CPUs means that
those CPUs were working at maximum. On a
system with four CPUs, that 2 reflects a workload using about half of
the available processing power.

Under normal circumstances you'll want the load average to be 70% of
your total CPU usage or less. You can check the number of CPUs available
to your instance by running the following command:

    grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l

If the load averages show that the load is increasing and is above the
number of CPUs, you should look into the cause of the high load. A load
above the number of CPUs means that the system is having to queue up
processor requests, which reduces performance.

### top

The `top` command displays real time information regarding the server's
resource usage. The first few lines will give you a summary of the
resource utilisation on your system and you can sort the list of
processes by CPU (P) or memory (M) use which allows you to quickly see
where your server is receiving the biggest demands on its resources.

### vmstat

The amount of memory a system has is one of the most common restraining
factors. The swap is an area of the hard drive where data is moved to
free up physical memory (RAM) for a process to use (not all servers have
swap space configured). A system using its swap area does not
necessarily mean it is low on memory, but if most of your system's swap
is being consumed it could indicate that your server is trying to do
more than its available memory permits.

If swap space is configured and you suspect your server is running out
of standard memory, you can use `vmstat` to show how much swapping is
occurring.

The following example displays a system's virtual memory statistics 10
times at 5 second intervals.

    $ vmstat 5 10
    procs -----------memory-------------  ---swap---- -----io---- --system--  -----cpu------

In the example the `free` column shows that the amount of free memory is
only around 4MB.

The `si` and `so` columns show the amount of data being transferred
between the system's swap and its memory. In this example you can see
there is lots of data being moved. `so` is the amount of data being
moved to the swap to free up memory. `si` is the amount of data being
pulled from the swap back in to memory. This happens when the data is
required for a process to run.

When a server is constantly swapping into and out of memory it is an
indication that the load it is being placed under is too great for the
resources it has available. top can be used to help identify the
processes that are consuming the most resources.

### Summary

If top and vmstat indicate that the server is using all its resources
you need to look at optimising your current set up; this can include
running any processing jobs outside peak hours, killing any processes no
longer required and reconfiguring processes so they require less
resources. You may also want to consider increasing the size of your
server to better match your requirements.

Assuming your application is running and looks healthy, let's now check
that it is listening for network connections. We can see if the service
is listening on the correct socket using the netstat command, which
we'll cover in [Checking Listening Ports with netstat](/how-to/checking-listening-ports-with-netstat).

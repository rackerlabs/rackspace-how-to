High Performance Computing (HPC) enables scientists and researchers to
solve complex problems that require many computing capabilities. HPC
typically utilizes a message passing interface (MPI) to communicate
between different nodes.

### HPC in Cloud

Currently, most projects requiring HPC are still running on legacy Unix
systems. Migrating these projects to a Cloud-based installation is very
simple and does not require much additional setup. In this tutorial, we
will build an HPC cluster with Open MPI on the Rackspace Cloud. Next, we
will run an Open MPI application on top of our cluster. By the end of
this tutorial, you will know how to leverage the Cloud to rapidly build
and scale an HPC cluster for real-time data processing while removing
the dependency on physical infrastructure.

### Open MPI

To achieve high performance clustering in the Cloud, we will use Open
MPI, which is a Message Passing Interface project. It provides parallel
processing, thread safety and concurrency, dynamic process spawning, and
network and fault tolerance. This library is used by the world's fastest
super computers and is instrumental in powering many petaflops. To find
out more about Open MPI library, visit their site:
<http://www.open-mpi.org/>.

### Objective

In this tutorial, we will show you how to build an HPC cluster using the
following:

1.  Four Rackspace Cloud Servers
2.  Open MPI

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are expected for successful completion of
this tutorial:

-   Rackspace Cloud account ( <https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/> )
-   SSH client (Windows users download PuTTY from here:
    <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html> )
-   A basic knowledge of Linux and Open MPI

### Installation Process

In this tutorial, we will be setting up a four-node cluster, running
applications on it, and gauging the performance.

*Figure 1 - HPC on the Cloud High Level Architecture*

In this tutorial, we will show you how to:

1.  Create a Cloud Server
2.  Install Open MPI
3.  Enable Clustering
4.  Configure HPC
5.  Create and deploy a Cloud Server image
6.  Install and run a sample Open MPI enabled application

### Create a Cloud Server

Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) and create a Cloud Server from
the web interface with the following attributes.

-  Server name: **yourname-HPC-node-01**
-  Region: **Dallas (DFW)**
-  Image (Rackspace): **Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin)**
-  Size: **2GB of RAM** or higher

Click **Create Server** and the Cloud Server will begin building. During this time, a popup will
appear with the Cloud Server password. Record this information as you
will need it later. Dismiss the popup window and wait for the server
build to complete. Write down IP address for the server as it becomes
available.

### Install Open MPI

Once the server finishes building and is in Available status, SSH into
it and log in using the IP address and password you recorded earlier.

    ssh root@<Your Server IP>

After logging in, execute the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install build-essential -y
    apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-checkpoint openmpi-common openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev -y

### Enable Clustering

As mentioned earlier, Open MPI facilitates communication between nodes
via SSH, therefore, we will need to enable key-based logins for SSH.

To do this, run the following commands:

    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    echo "StrictHostKeyChecking no" >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C "Open MPI"

The output of these commands should look similar to the following:

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    35:85:97:3c:98:89:8d:bc:58:96:97:41:ad:0b:a6:c8 Enter an optional comment about your key
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |       . *oX..   |
    |        B O.*    |
    |       + ooo .   |
    |      . +...     |
    |   . . oS. .     |
    |    E .   .      |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+

**Note:** You will be prompted for a passphrase during this process.
Leave it blank.

Copy the key to authorized key folder and change permissions to allow
SSH logins:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

### Configure HPC

Now we are going to configure the master HPC node by creating a host
file. To do this, ensure you are logged in to the first node over SSH
and create the following file where <Your Server IP> is the IP
address you used to SSH into the machine:

    cd ~/
    echo <Your Server IP> >> mpi_hosts

To verify the file:

    cat mpi_hosts

You should see:

    <Your Server IP>

To verify we have configured everything correctly so far, we will use
the hello_c.c from the examples included with Open MPI.

To do this, follow these steps:

    mkdir /root/samples
    cd /root/samples
    wget http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/ompi/tags/v1.6-series/v1.6.4/examples/hello_c.c
    mpicc hello_c.c -o hello
    mpirun ./hello

This should output the following:

    Hello, world, I am 0 of 1

Now that it works, get the second example, which we will use it for
testing connectivity:

    wget http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/ompi/tags/v1.6-series/v1.6.4/examples/connectivity_c.c
    mpicc connectivity_c.c -o connectivity
    mpirun ./connectivity

You should see the following output:

    Connectivity test on 1 processes PASSED.

Now that we have confirmed that the first node is online and
operational, we will finish building the cluster.

### Create and Deploy a Cloud Server Image

With our first node created, we are ready to set up a cluster. We will
need to make copies of the node we just created. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) again
and follow these steps to create an image:

1.  Navigate to the servers list
2.  Select the server you created for the first node
3.  Click on the **Actions** drop down menu
4.  Click **Create Image**. See *Figure 2* for details.
5.  When prompted, provide a meaningful name as shown in *Figure 3*.
6.  Finally, click **Create Image** and wait a few minutes for the image
    to be created.

<img src="{% asset_path cloud-servers/high-performance-computing-cluster-in-a-cloud-environment/create%20image.png %}" alt="Naming the Image" width="400" height="127" />

*Figure 3 - Naming the Image*

When completed, deploy a new Cloud Server using our prior procedure with
the following exception; when prompted for image, click the Saved tab.
Again, you will need to provide a meaningful name. Additionally, record
the password and IP address.

Let's say that the IP of your new server is 10.20.30.40, and the
IP/hostname of your first server is <Your Server IP>. To add the
new node to the cluster, do the following:

    SSH to your first server
    cd ~/
    cat >> mpi_hosts <<EOF
    10.20.30.40
    EOF

Now, your host file should resemble this:

    <Your Server IP>
    10.20.30.40

To test the connectivity between the nodes, execute the following
command:

    mpirun -v -np 2 --hostfile ~/mpi_hosts /root/samples/connectivity

If you don't get any errors, you have just successfully created and
tested your own tiny cloud cluster! To increase the size of the cluster,
add two more nodes using the same procedure.

To test the connectivity between the four-node cluster, execute the
following command:

    mpirun -v -np 4 --hostfile ~/mpi_hosts /root/samples/connectivity

### Install and Run a Sample Open MPI enabled Application

Now that we have an Open MPI cluster, let's see how it performs. We will
use a simple ray tracing application that can run on a single node or on
an Open MPI cluster and compare the performance.

First, we will need to install this application on all nodes of the
cluster. To do this, SSH into the master node and do the following:

    for i in `cat mpi_hosts`; do ssh root@$i "curl -l http://openstack.prov12n.com/files/tachyon.sh | bash"; done
    cd ~/tachyon/compile/linux-mpi

The Tachyon Parallel / Multiprocessor Ray Tracing System comes with
multiple sample data files in the scenes folder, we will be using them
to run our tests. First, lets run it on one node:

    cd ~/tachyon/compile/linux-mpi
    ./tachyon ../../scenes/teapot.dat

You should see the following output:

    Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version 0.99
    Copyright 1994-2011,    John E. Stone <john.stone@gmail.com>
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Scene Parsing Time:     0.0221 seconds
    Scene contains 2330 objects.
    Preprocessing Time:     0.0052 seconds
    Rendering Progress:       100% complete
      Ray Tracing Time:     2.1399 seconds
        Image I/O Time:     0.0174 seconds

Note the ray tracing time as we will compare it to our parallel run:

    mpirun -np 4 --hostfile ~/mpi_hosts ./tachyon ../../scenes/teapot.dat -format BMP

You should see the following output:

    Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version 0.99
    Copyright 1994-2011,    John E. Stone <john.stone@gmail.com>
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Scene Parsing Time:     0.0230 seconds
    Scene contains 2330 objects.
    Preprocessing Time:     0.0052 seconds
    Rendering Progress:       100% complete
      Ray Tracing Time:     0.6048 seconds
        Image I/O Time:     0.0182 seconds

Our cluster consisted of four nodes and one CPU each, therefore, the
performance improvement was almost four times greater. Even if you don't
have multiple nodes and run your application on one node, but tell
OpenMPI to use both CPUs, you will still have significant improvements.

This is why it is important that our server was created with at least
2GB of RAM because sizes 2GB and higher have access to at least 2 CPUs.
For more information on sizes,
see <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/techdetails/>.

Now we can run this code on multiple CPUs of a single server.

    mpirun -np 2 ./tachyon ../../scenes/teapot.dat -format BMP

You should see the following output:

    Tachyon Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracer   Version 0.99
    Copyright 1994-2011,    John E. Stone <john.stone@gmail.com>
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Scene Parsing Time:     0.0222 seconds
    Scene contains 2330 objects.
    Preprocessing Time:     0.0050 seconds
    Rendering Progress:       100% complete
      Ray Tracing Time:     1.0888 seconds
        Image I/O Time:     0.0181 seconds

Notice that even when running on a single node but utilizing Open MPI,
the performance has almost doubled. To read more about this ray tracing
application, visit <http://jedi.ks.uiuc.edu/~johns/raytracer/>.

### Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to create and image Cloud Servers. You
also learned how to setup an HPC cluster using Open MPI. After setting
up and configuring the cluster, you installed a small ray tracing
application to demonstrate the benefits of using multiple nodes instead
of one node.

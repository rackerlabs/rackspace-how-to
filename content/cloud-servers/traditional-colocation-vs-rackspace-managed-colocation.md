[Colocation](http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation/index.php)
typically describes the provisioning of space for IT infrastructure and
equipment on a service provider's premises. Business who choose
colocation often do so to maintain the control of their operating
systems but still have a need for the physical space in which to house
their infrastructure.

**Traditional Colocation: The Basics**   In a traditional colocation
scenario, the vendor supplies:

-   Physical space (floor space-cabinets or cages)
-   Power to the cabinet/cages (conditioned power, battery backup, and
    backup power generators)
-   Adequate cooling and redundancy
-   Security (video surveillance, guard-monitored floor, and
    locked space)
-   Fire suppression
-   Network Connection (some only allow for a set list of providers)

    It should be noted that top tier colocation vendors also have
options for additional services. (i.e, inventory space, access to
multiple network providers, remote hand options).   In traditional
colocation, the customer also has a fair share of the responsibility.
This includes:

-   Procurement of the IT infrastructure, including receiving and
    installation via hardware reseller or vendor (Cisco, HP, Dell, etc.)
-   Procurement of the network connectivity and installation into the
    cabinet or cage
-   Monitoring of all systems 24x7x365
-   Supporting, maintenance and replacement of all devices 24x7x365
-   Planning and scaling the configuration when appropriate
-   Management of staff and multiple vendors (colocation center,
    hardware provider, network provider)

It is also important to consider the hidden costs and non-operational
activities in a traditional colocation scenario:

-   Employee resources (management of staff dedicated to the hosting
    infrastructure; insurance; weekend, evening/overnight and holiday
    coverage; certifications and ongoing training)
-   Management of vendor relationships
-   Response to natural disasters
-   Security and compliance requirements (SAS-70, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
-   Maintenance of depreciating assets
-   Large capital expenditures with growth of business
-   Slow implementation times

**Managed Colocation from Rackspace**

Because many businesses prefer to maintain a substantial level of
control regarding their mission-critical apps, but don't want to be
slowed by the complexity of managing a traditional colocation scenario,

control with the added benefit of a support team to proactively manage
your config. Rackspace Managed Colocation is a level above traditional
colocation, meaning it offers more support than pure colocation.

Python-novaclient is a command-line client for controlling OpenStack
cloud server instances.  Because Cloud Servers are based on OpenStack, python-novaclient also works with Cloud Servers. The client provides a bit more functionality than the control panel without needing to delve into the API directly.

We have installation instructions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux:

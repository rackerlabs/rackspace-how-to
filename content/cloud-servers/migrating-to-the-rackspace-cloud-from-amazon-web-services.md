This guide is intended for developers who are migrating applications
from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Rackspace Cloud. It maps AWS
infrastructure products to Rackspace infrastructure products,
specifically Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2) to Rackspace Cloud
Servers. It then provides scenarios for specific stack migrations from
EC2 to Cloud Servers. The goal of this guide is to make your migration
as seamless as possible.

The guide begins by discussing equivalent products between AWS and
Rackspace Cloud, then covers several migration scenarios and the steps
involved in changing hosting environments.

The guide's organization is as follows:

- Overview (this document)
- [Mapping of Amazon Web Services resources to Rackspace resources](/how-to/mapping-of-amazon-web-services-resources-to-rackspace-resources)

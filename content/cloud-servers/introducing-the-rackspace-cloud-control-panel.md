### Organization

Several features help you organize, find, and efficiently manage your
resources no matter the size or shape of your cloud inventory.

-  **Tags** - Customized labels that can be added to any of the resources that make up your cloud infrastructure.

-  **Filters** - Enable you to find all resources that share the following common properties: Tag, Status, Image, RAM, Region, or Type.

   The list of filters is located at the left side of the control panel. When you create and tag resources, the list is automatically populated. When you select a check box next to a filter, the list of resources shows only the matching ones.

-  **Search** - A convenient and fast search field in the upper-right corner of each
asset listing gives you another method for locating any asset. Simply
enter part of the asset name, tag, or IP address in the search field.

### Administrative actions

The control panel provides a variety of ways to perform administrative
tasks. Whether you're looking at a list of assets or a detailed view of
a single asset, you don't need to leave your current location to perform
a task--every task you might want to perform is accessible right where
you are.

-  **Actions gear** - The gear icon to the left of a resource name which provides a drop-down menu with all available actions for that resources. The actions gear is always part of every list, whether it is a list of servers, files, or load balancers.

-  **Actions menu** - If you're looking at the details of a specific resource, you'll find the
**Actions** drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the screen.

-  **Edit pencils and options** - You can also edit an existing setting for a resource by clicking the
edit pencil or option that appears next to the resource description.

-  **Popup boxes** -  When you perform an administrative action on a resource, a popup dialog
box enables you to modify the settings or perform an action without taking you
to another page.

### Access the Cloud Sites Control Panel

You can reach the Cloud Sites Control Panel by selecting the option from
the **Rackspace Cloud** drop-down menu at the top left of the Cloud
Control Panel.

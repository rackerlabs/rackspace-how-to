### First Generation Cloud Servers terminology

#### Flavor

A resource configuration for a server. Each flavor is a unique combination of disk, memory, vCPUs, and network bandwidth.

#### Image

A collection of files for a specific operating system (OS) that you use to create or rebuild a server. Rackspace provides pre-built images. You can also create custom images from servers that you have launched. Custom images can be used for data backups or as "gold" images for additional servers.

#### Server

A virtual machine (VM) instance in the Cloud Servers environment. To create a server, you must specify a name, flavor reference, and image reference.

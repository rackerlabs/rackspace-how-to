Creating a support ticket in your [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) is the best way to communicate
with Rackspace Support Technicians. Following are the two ways through
which you can create a ticket:

1.  After you are logged in, click **Support** in the top
    navigation bar and select **Create or View a Ticket** in the
    pop-up window.

2.  Click on your **Account** in the top navigation bar, and in the
    drop-down menu, select **Support Tickets**.

When you click on the **Support Tickets** or **Create or View a
Ticket** link, you will see a list displaying your currently open
tickets, and a tab with the option to view your closed tickets. Each
ticket entry displays the name, the date it was last updated, the ticket
status, and ticket ID number. To create a new ticket, click **Create Ticket**.

When you create a new ticket, you can select a broad product category,
such as Cloud Servers or Cloud Databases, and then a more
specific category that narrows down the type of problem you are
experiencing, such as General Support, or API. In
the **Details** section, enter a subject and message describing your
issue. You can also attach a file up to 20 MB to the ticket. After you
have entered information into all the fields, click **Submit Ticket**.

The best way to communicate with our Support Technicians and provide
specific details about a problem that you are experiencing is by opening
a ticket.  The advantage of using a ticket is that it allows you to copy
& paste or attach cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error
log entries directly into the ticket.

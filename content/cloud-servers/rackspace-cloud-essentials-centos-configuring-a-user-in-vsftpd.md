[Rackspace Cloud Essentials - Install vsftpd for CentOS](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-essentials-centos-configuring-a-user-in-vsftpd)

This article describes how to create system users in vstfpd and
chroot them (isolate or "jail" them to their home directory) if necessary.

### Add group for sftp users

    groupadd sftp
### Add a system user

If you don't already have a group for your sftp users, add a group.

    groupadd sftp

Create a new user for FTP access in vsftpd by creating a new valid Linux system user.

    useradd test
    passwd test

### Disable SSH access for FTP users

The default user creation script gives a user the `/bin/bash` shell,
which can be a little too powerful. If you don't want your users
to log in to your server via SSH, you can block this access. When you 
change the shell to `/bin/false`, the users can log in only
via FTP or mail if you have that set up. 

Modify the user access as follows:

    usermod -s /sbin/nologin test

### Chroot a user

Now you can configure vsftpd to be able to chroot (commonly referred to as jailing) 
users to their home directories for security and privacy. When you chroot users, 
they canâ€™t move up a level in the directory structure after they log in.

Change the user's group to the 'sftp' group:-

    usermod -g sftp test

Set the user's shell to /bin/false:-

    usermod -s /bin/false test

Edit the subsystem in sshd_config (/etc/ssh/):

    #Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
    Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

Add the following to the bottom of the `sshd_config` file:-

    Match group sftp
        X11Forwarding no
        ChrootDirectory %h
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp

Change the following directories access to

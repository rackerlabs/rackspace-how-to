### Previous section

[Rackspace Cloud Essentials - Install vsftpd for CentOS](/how-to/rackspace-cloud-essentials-centos-configuring-a-user-in-vsftpd)

This article describes how to create system users in vstfpd and
chroot them (isolate or "jail" them to their home directory) if necessary.

Create a new user for FTP access in vsftpd by creating a new valid Linux system user.

    useradd test
    passwd test

### Disable SSH access for FTP users

The default user creation script gives a user the `/bin/bash` shell,
which can be a little too powerful. If you don't want your users
to log in to your server via SSH, you can block this access. When you
change the shell to `/bin/false`, the users can log in only
via FTP or mail if you have that set up.

Modify the user access as follows:

    usermod -s /sbin/nologin test

### Chroot a user

With vsftpd, you can chroot a user by editing the following in the file `/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf`:  

    chroot_local_user=YES
    chroot_list_enable=YES
    chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list

You will need to create a vsftp.chroot_list file and enter users who do *not* use chroot. Ever user chroots by default. Therefore, create a chroot_list file, even if the file is going to remain empty:

    touch /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.chroot_list

Once the file is created and you have setup your chroot_list, restart vsftpd.

    service vsftpd restart

An extremely important aspect of managing your server is controlling the
(Linux) **root** or (Windows) **Administrator** account password. You
can always reset it through the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com).

### Reset your server password

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/).

2. Click the gear icon next to the server for which you want to
change the password.

3. Under "Manage", click **Change Password**.

4. Enter the new password and click **Save Password**.

After you enter the new password, your server will reboot and the new
password will be set.

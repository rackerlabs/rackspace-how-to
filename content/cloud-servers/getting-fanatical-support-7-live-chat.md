### Live Chat

We have Support Technicians standing by 24 hours a day to answer any questions you have. Under the Live Chat
link, you will be directed into a Live Chat session with specialists
trained to support our various products. Choose the appropriate Live
Chat link for the product you need assistance with.

With all the support resources and support staff made available to you,
it's no wonder why Rackspace is known as the home of Fanatical Support! This completes our tour of the Control Panel, but there is one other
way to manage your services that we have not looked at yet. If you have
an iPhone, iPad, or Android device, you will want to read [Getting Started with the Rackspace Mobile Application and Managing Accounts](/how-to/getting-started-with-the-rackspace-mobile-application-and-managing-accounts).

To work with your cloud server you must establish a connection to it
from your local computer. How you make the connection depends on your
server operating system and desktop operating system.

### Linux server

Use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to your Linux server. For connection
instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop operating
system:

-   [Connecting to Linux from Mac OS X by using Terminal](/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-mac-os-x-by-using-terminal)
-   [Connecting to Linux from Windows by using PuTTY](/how-to/connecting-to-linux-from-windows-by-using-putty)

If you can't use SSH to access a Linux server remotely, you can
access its command line by using the [console in the Cloud Control Panel](/how-to/start-a-console-session).

### Windows server

Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log in to your Windows server. For
connection instructions, see the appropriate article for your desktop
operating system:

-   [Logging in to Your Server via RDP (Windows)](/how-to/log-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)

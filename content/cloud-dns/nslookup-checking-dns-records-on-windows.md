You might need to check the status of your DNS records for many reasons. For
example, you might need to verify that any updates are correct or to
troubleshoot issues accessing a particular service. Windows has a
built-in tool for checking your DNS records, `nslookup`.

To access `nslookup` open up a command prompt window. Go to **Start > All Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt**.

### Check for a record

To check for a specific record you need to specify the `nslookup` command,
the record type &mdash; for example, A, MX, or TXT &mdash; and the host name you want to check. The following
example shows how to check for any A records for **rackspace.co.uk**:

    C:\Users\Administrator>nslookup -type=A rackspace.co.uk
    Server:  cachens1.lon.rackspace.com>
    Address:  83.138.151.80

    Non-authoritative answer:

    Name:    rackspace.co.uk
    Address:  212.64.133.165

The first two lines of output specify the server to which the request
was directed which is the default server that your system uses for DNS
name resolution. The second section, which specifies a non-authoritative
answer, gives the name of the record and the corresponding IP address.
The answer is non-authoritative because the answer comes from a server,
**cachens1.lon.rackspace.com** in this case, that is not the root source for
those records.

### Get an authoritative answer

To get an authoritative answer you need to go to the source. You can do this
by specifying the authoritative name server at the end of the
request.

Use the `-type=soa` option to tell `nslookup` to display the
authoritative (primary) name server.

    C:\Users\Administrator>nslookup -type=soa rackspace.co.uk
    Server:  cachens1.lon.rackspace.com>
    Address:  83.138.151.80

    Non-authoritative answer:
    rackspace.co.uk
            primary name server = ns.rackspace.com
            responsible mail addr = hostmaster.rackspace.com
            serial  = 1415913000
            refresh = 3600 (1 hour)
            retry   = 300 (5 mins)
            expire  = 1814400 (21 days)
            default TTL = 300 (5 mins)

    ns.rackspace.com        internet address = 69.20.95.4

The address labeled `primary name server` is the DNS authority for the
domain.

If you add the address of the authoritative name server
(**ns.rackspace.com**) to the first command, the record is now checked
against that name server.

    C:\Users\Administrator>nslookup -type=A rackspace.co.uk ns.rackspace.com
    Server:  ns.rackspace.com
    Address:  69.20.95.4

    Name:    rackspace.co.uk
    Address:  212.64.133.165

### Check when a cached record will expire

DNS uses caching, which reduces the load on authoritative name servers
but means that sometimes records can be out of date. If the
authoritative and non-authoritative answers differ, you will have a cached
response from the resolver name server you are using. The length of time that a
record is cached depends on its time-to-live (TTL) value. This is a number
specified in seconds.

To see how long a record is cached, include the `debug` option, as shown in
the following example:

    C:\Users\Administrator>nslookup -type=A -debug rackspace.co.uk

    Non-authoritative answer:

    Name:    rackspace.co.uk
    Address:  212.64.133.165

-   The first `Got answer` section of this example is used to get the
    hostname of the server from which you are requesting the A record from,
    in this case **cachens1.lon.rackspace.com**.
-   The second `Got answer` section relates to your actual request.
-   The `HEADER` section contains details about the type of request and
    its success.
-   The `QUESTIONS` section shows that the request was for A records
    for rackspace.co.uk.
-   The `ANSWERS` section displays one record with an IP address of
    212.64.133.165 and a TTL of 279 seconds (4 minutes 39 seconds).
-   The `AUTHORITY RECORDS` section specifies the name servers that
    correspond to the domain
-   The `ADDITIONAL RECORDS` section lists A records for the name servers
    listed in the authority records section

So from this response, you can see that the name server being used by the client
computer will reuse the same A record for **rackspace.co.uk** for the
next 4 minutes and 39 seconds. If you were to run the same command on
the authoritative name server you would see what the current maximum TTL
for the record is.

When specifying Time To Live (TTL) you should be aware of the following important factors:

-  The higher the TTL, the less frequently caching name servers need to query authoritative name servers.

  A higher TTL reduces the perceived latency of a site and decreases the dependency on the authoritative name servers.

-  The lower the TTL, the more frequently updates are propagated to other name servers.

  If youâ€™re going to make DNS changes, we suggest lowering the TTL to make the changes. If you're using DNS for failover, then lowering the TTL is a good idea as it takes less time to fail-over to another server.

Generally, we recommend a TTL of 24 hours (86,400 seconds). However, if you are planning to make DNS changes, you should lower the TTL to 5 minutes (300 seconds) at least 24 hours in advance of making the changes. After the changes are made, increase the TTL back to 24 hours.

**Note**: If DNS is used for failover, then you should probably keep the TTL at approximately 5 minutes all the time.

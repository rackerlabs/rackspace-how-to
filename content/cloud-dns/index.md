The Domain Name System (DNS) is essentially the phonebook for the Internet. It
manages the relationships between IP addresses (the phone numbers) and domains
(individuals and corporations). All domains and their components, such as mail
servers, use DNS to resolve to the appropriate locations.

For Cloud DNS, we have made available a public ReST API to interact with our
DNS infrastructure programmatically. This significantly helps you automate and
simplify your domain management.

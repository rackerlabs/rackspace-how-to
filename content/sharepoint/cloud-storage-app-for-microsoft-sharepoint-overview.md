Rackspace Cloud Storage App *for Microsoft SharePoint* enables you to
work with files inside of Rackspace Cloud Files alongside SharePoint
content. You can download the Cloud Storage App from the SharePoint
Store. Cloud Storage App reduces costs and frees valuable space on a SharePoint
deployment's Microsoft SQL Server databases by storing data in your
cloud account. The app also gives you the ability to expose Cloud Files
containers and objects directly in SharePoint websites where you can
download, upload, modify, and share files with others. With Cloud
Storage App, you can perform the following tasks:

-   Manage Cloud Files objects directly inside your SharePoint portal
-   Add objects to Cloud File containers using a drag-and-drop user
    interface
-   Delete objects from Cloud File containers one at a time or in bulk
-   Collaborate with others, even users who do not have SharePoint
    credentials, by generating temporary URLs that expire after a
    certain number of days

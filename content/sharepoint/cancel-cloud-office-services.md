To cancel a Cloud Office email or SharePoint account, log in to the
Cloud Office Control Panel and perform the following steps:

1.  In the top-right corner of the window, click the down arrow next to
    your account number.
2.  From the menu, select **Upgrades & Services**.

    If you do not see the **Upgrades &** **Services** option in the
    menu, confirm that you have the proper permissions to access
    this feature. If you do not, you likely have an enterprise account
    and need to submit a ticket with your cancellation request.

3.  In the options listed at the top of the tab, click **Service
    Summary**.

4.  In the **Action** column of the service that you want to cancel,
    click **Cancel Service**.

5.  For **Cancellation Date**, enter the date that you want the services
    to end.
    **Note**: Date selected must be the following day's date or later.

6.  Click **Submit Request**. A **Pending Cancellation** status is displayed next to the services
    to be canceled.

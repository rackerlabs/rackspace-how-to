**Previous section:** [Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint:
Overview](/how-to/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-overview)

The Rackspace Cloud Files platform enables you to generate temporary
URLs that you can use to grant others access to objects within your
Cloud Files account for the amount of time that you specify. The
Rackspace Cloud Storage App for Microsoft SharePoint implements this
functionality.

### Generating a temporary URL ###

1.  Within the app, navigate to a container.

    <img src="{% asset_path sharepoint/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-how-to-share-a-file-with-another-person/Fig%20--%20Share%20Icon.jpg %}" width="447" height="190" />

2.  Click the share icon on the far right of one of the files in
    the container.

    <img src="{% asset_path sharepoint/cloud-storage-app-for-microsoft-sharepoint-how-to-share-a-file-with-another-person/Fig%20--%20Share%20Dialog.jpg %}" width="448" height="212" />

3.  Enter the number of days that you want the link to be active, and
    click **Get Link**. The link is active until the date shown in the
    dialog box.

You can then copy the link from the text box and send it to anyone with
whom you want to share the file. When a browser navigates to the
provided URL, the user is prompted to download the associated file.

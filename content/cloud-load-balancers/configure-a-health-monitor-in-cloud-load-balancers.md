The Cloud Load Balancers service includes a health monitoring operation
that helps keep your load balancer operating smoothly by routing traffic 
only to nodes that are functioning properly.

You can use this service by updating the load balancer configuration settings 
to add a health monitor. You can configure one health monitor per load balancer.

After you configure monitoring, the health monitor periodically checks 
the health of each node associated with load balancer, including new nodes that are added.
If the health monitor detects a node that is not responding, the node is removed from the
load balancer rotation until the health monitor determines that the node is functional. 


### Configure a health monitor

1.  Log in to the Cloud Control Panel.
2.  In the top navigation bar, click **Networking &gt; Load
    Balancers.** 

    All existing load balancers for your account
    are displayed.
    
3.  Click the gear icon next load balancer name that you want to monitor, then select **Edit Health
    Monitoring**.

4.  In the popup dialog box, select a **Monitor Type:**

    -   **CONNECT**: The Connect health monitor connects to each node on
        its defined port to ensure that the service is
        listening correctly. The Connect monitor is the most basic type
        of health check and does no postprocessing or protocol-specific
        health checks. Provide the required information for this
        monitor.

        -   **Interval**: Minimum number of seconds to wait before
            executing the health monitor; must be a number between 1
            and 3600.
        -   **Timeout**: Maximum number of seconds to wait for a
            connection to be established before timing out; must be a
            number between 1 and 300.
        -   **Attempts**: Number of permissible monitor failures before
            removing a node from rotation; must be a number between 1
            and 10.
            
    -   **HTTP**: The HTTP health monitor is more intelligent than the
        Connect monitor. It can process an HTTP response to determine
        the actual condition of a node. Provide the required information
        for this monitor.

        -   **Interval**: Minimum number of seconds to wait before
            executing the health monitor; must be a number between 1
            and 3600.
        -   **Timeout**: Maximum number of seconds to wait for a
            connection to be established before timing out; must be a
            number between 1 and 300.
        -   **Attempts**: Number of permissible monitor failures before
            removing a node from rotation; must be a number between 1
            and 10.
        -   **HTTP Path**: The HTTP path that will be used in the
            sample request.
        -   **Status Regex**: A regular expression that will be used to
            evaluate the HTTP status code returned in the response. For
            example, you could use the regular expression
            **\^(500|40\[1348\])\$** to look for *unsuccessful* status
            codes (500, 401, 403, 404, and 408) returned in the
            response, or you could use the regular expression
            **\^\[2\]\[0\]\[02\]\$** to look for *successful* status
            codes of 200 and 202 in the response.
        -   **Body Regex**: A regular expression that will be used to
            evaluate the contents of the body of the response. For
            example you could use the regular expression
            **\^.\*(Unauthorized|Forbidden|Not Found|Timeout|Server
            Error).\*\$** to look for any of those potentially
            problematic strings in the body of the response, or you
            could use the regular expression **\^success\$** to look for
            the string **success**. 
            
            **Note**: The system evaluates only the first 2048 bytes of the
          response against the body regex that you specify, so you should test
          accordingly. See [Tip](#tip1).

5.  Click **Save Monitoring Settings** to apply your changes.

**Tip:**  To debug the HTTP health monitoring, test the body regex against the IP address of the nodes that are being disabled.  You can use the following cURL command to see what the health monitoring analyzes:

          $ curl -s -r 0-2048 https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS | head -c 2048 | egrep "YOUR_REGULAR_EXPRESSION"
          
### Disable a health monitor

1.  Click the gear icon next to the load balancer that you want to update, then select **Edit Health
    Monitoring**.
2.  In the health monitor form, click **Disable**. 
3.  Click **Disable Health Monitor** to apply the change.

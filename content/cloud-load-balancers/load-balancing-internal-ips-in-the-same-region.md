All Next Generation Cloud Servers automatically receive three IP
addresses upon creation:

-   A version 4 **IP Address** that provides public access
    to your server from anywhere on the Internet.
-   A version 6 **IP Address** that also provides public access to your
    from anywhere on the Internet.
-   An internal **Rackspace Network** (ServiceNet) IP address that
    enables you to access the server from other Cloud Servers or Cloud Load
    Balancers over the internal Rackspace Network.

The following screenshot shows the three IP address in the **Server Details** section for a server named "Zippy" in the
[Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com):

### Use regions and the Rackspace Network to manage bandwidth charges

If your Cloud Server (also known as a **node** within the Cloud Load
Balancers product) and Cloud Load Balancer are set up in the *same
region*, they can send traffic over the Rackspace Network without
traversing the Internet, and therefore incur zero bandwidth charges.
This not only saves you money, but speeds up performance of the load
balancer. However, if the node is in the Chicago region and your Load
Balancer is set up in Dallas, traffic cannot go across the Rackspace
Network only. It must traverse the internet, which incurs normal
bandwidth charges that will appear on your monthly invoice.

#### Selecting a Load Balancer's Region

To take advantage of this cost savings and performance feature, you'll
need to match the location of your Cloud Load Balancer with the node.
The following screenshot shows you Configuration area of the Create Load
Balancer page in the Cloud Control Panel.

Select the region in the Identification section of the Create Load Balancer screen in the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com).

**Note:** If you're load balancing an external node (one that is
external to the Rackspace Cloud), choose the region that is
geographically closest to the external node.

### General

#### How is the Rackspace Customer Security Operations Center different from a normal SOC?

#### What platforms does Rackspace PDR currently support?

Rackspace PDR currently supports:
* Rackspace Dedicated Servers
* Fanatical Amazon AWS
* Google Cloud Platform
* Fanatical Azure Cloud

#### What if I currently use some of the agents or tooling Rackspace PDR uses?

If you currently have products we use to help provide visibility and telemetry back to our Security Operations Center, we will work with you to migrate or redeploy existing tooling.

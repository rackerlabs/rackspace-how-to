Restriction rules limit who can see your content. Restriction rules
define the traffic to *allow* or to *block*. (For example, a
**Referrer** value of **website.com** with **Allow** chosen, *allows*
traffic being requested from **website.com**. If **Block** is chosen,
traffic is denied.)

When you create multiple rules, you must order rules from least specific
to most specific.

For more information about rules, see the following sections and
[Rackspace CDN edge
rules](/how-to/rackspace-cdn-edge-rules).

After you create your service, you enter restriction rules in the
**Restrictions** section of the CDN service page.

### To create a restriction

After you have created your service, follow these steps to create a
restriction:

1\. Click **Add Rule**. A popup dialog box displays.

2\. Enter the following information to define the rule:

-   **Name**: A name for the rule.
-   **Type**: **Referrer**, **Geography**, and **Client IP** address are
    the restriction types currently supported. Choose one from the drop
    down menu.
-   **Access**: **Access** enables you to **Allow** or **Block** access
    to your content.
-   **Referrer**: The domain that is allowed to access your edge
    node content. You can enter a URL with or without **http://**.
-   **Path**: Path for the rule. Path defines which content enforces
    your restriction. To apply the restriction to your entire site, use
    the path "/\*".

**Note**: You can add multiple **Referrer** domains that use the same
**Path** by separating the list of domains with a space, as shown in the
following example.

3\. Click **Save Rule**. The **Service Status** is **Pending** until the
new restriction is deployed. After the restriction is deployed, it
displays in the **Restrictions** list.

### To edit a restriction

To edit a restriction, follow these steps:

1\. Click the gear icon beside the rule that you want to edit, and select
**Edit Rule**.

2\. Edit the **Name**, **Type**, **Access**, **Referrer**, or the
**Path** for the rule.

3\. Click **Save Rule**. The **Service Status** is **Pending** until the
edited restriction is deployed. After the edited restriction is
deployed, it displays in the **Restrictions** list.



### To delete a restriction

To delete a restriction, follow these steps:

1\. Click the gear icon beside the rule that you want to delete, and
select **Delete Rule**.

2\. In the popup dialog box, click **Delete Rule**.

<img src="{% asset_path rackspace-cdn/create-and-manage-restrictions-in-rackspace-cdn/DeleteOriginRule_1.png %}" width="197" height="128" />

The **Service Status** is **Pending** until the restriction is deleted.
After the restriction is deleted, it is removed from the
**Restrictions** list.

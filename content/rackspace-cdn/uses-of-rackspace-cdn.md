Following are some uses of Rackspace CDN:

**Website acceleration**

Commonly built with a mix of static objects and text, formatting like
CSS, and some media components like marketing videos, websites can be
CDN enabled quickly and easily.  With origin-pull technology, you simply
identify a host name and an origin, and your entire site is cached and
accelerated.

**Application acceleration**

Applications often have many cacheable components, like pictures, static
text, and style formatting, that can be cached on the edge.  For
dynamic, noncacheable content, Rackspace CDN finds the best route back
to the origin and prefetches upcoming material to improve delivery
speeds.

**Blogs and database-powered content**

Instead of having your web servers render content for *every* unique
visit, you can use a CDN to deliver cached content to website visitors
instead. This reduces the overall load on your local web server and
database, because HTML is being served in a edge location local to the
user. Apart from this CPU efficiency, users will also get content faster
because the latency has improved.

**eCommerce stores**

For eCommerce stores with many photos and static assets, rendering
product pages can involve paying for a large amount of outgoing
bandwidth. If your eCommerce platform renders images dynamically (for
custom dimensions, for example), this gets even more expensive.
Rackspace CDN enables you to selectively cache certain subdomains or URL
patterns to edge nodes. Users get content from the edge node rather than
your web servers.

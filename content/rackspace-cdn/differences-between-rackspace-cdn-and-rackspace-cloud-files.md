Rackspace Cloud Files is storage service that enables users to store an
unlimited number of files and to publish and distribute content behind a
content delivery network (CDN). Following are some differences between
Rackspace CDN and Cloud Files:

-   Users of Rackspace CDN specify the origins that host the content,
    and the CDN pulls the content from these origins. Origins can be
    dedicated servers, cloud servers, cloud load balancers, or even
    servers hosted outside of Rackspace. Users of Cloud Files can
    CDN-enable a container, thereby distributing the contents of that
    container to the CDN's edge nodes. In Rackspace CDN, it is not yet
    possible to specify a Cloud Files container as an origin.
-   Rackspace CDN has no limit on purges. Cloud Files limits the number
    of purges per account, per day to 25.
-   Rackspace CDN does not yet support streaming video from Cloud Files
    CDN-enabled containers or serving CDN-enabled content over SSL/TLS.
    Cloud Files supports streaming video from CDN-enabled containers as
    well as serving CDN-enabled content over SSL/TLS.

These, and other differences, are summarized in the following table:

| | Rackspace CDN | Cloud Files CDN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Origin | Any public web server | Cloud Files CDN-enabled Container |
| Custom domains | Customizable for HTTP and HTTPS (HTTPS via SAN or Custom SSL) | CNAME for HTTP only |
| Caching rules (TTL) | Customizable | Flat per Container |
| Force Refresh Content | Purge (per file)<br />Invalidate (Simple RegEX) | Purge (per file)<br />Limit 25 per day |
| Restrictions | HTTP Referrer, GeoLocation, IP Address | N/A |
| Streaming | No Support Provided (HTML5 compatible) | Chunked encoded streaming and iOS streaming available |
